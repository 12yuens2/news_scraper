[{"title":"Two children die after house fire in Hamstead, Birmingham","body":"Two children have died in hospital after a \"suspicious\" house fire, police have said.\nThe pair, a boy and a girl, were found at the property in Holland Road, Hamstead, Birmingham.\nDespite attempts by fire crews to resuscitate them, \"nothing could be done\" to save either child, the ambulance service said.\nPost-mortem examinations are due to take place later, West Midlands Police said.\nA woman was also assessed by the ambulance service but did not suffer any serious injuries.\nLive updates on this story\nResidents told the BBC a neighbour had carried the children out of the house and laid them on the lawn.\nFirefighters were called to the scene at about 03:40 BST, and extinguished a fire in the hallway.\nLess than two hours earlier paramedics had attended a shooting in nearby Handsworth Wood. \nPolice have launched a murder investigation but said it is not related to the fire.\nDet Insp Justin Spanner said: \"The events of this morning remain unclear and we are still trying to piece together the circumstances leading up to what happened.\n\"This is a terrible incident and my thoughts are with everyone who has been affected. \n\"If there was anyone in the area in the early hours of this morning who thinks they may be able to help us with our investigation I would urge them to get in touch with my team.\"\nA West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said the two children were in cardiac arrest when they arrived.\n\"Bystanders had already started CPR which crews took over before also administering advanced life support,\"  he said.\nThey were treated on the way to hospital, he said, but shortly after arrival \"it became clear that nothing could be done to save either child and they were confirmed deceased\".\nWest Midlands Fire Service said its investigators were working with police to establish how the fire started.\nFlowers have since been laid at the scene.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement"],"matchingTokens":[7],"entityId":"Hamstead, West

set to miss target on foreign patient costs","body":"The government is expected to fall well short of its target of recovering £500m a year from overseas visitors treated in NHS hospitals in England.\nThe Department of Health has \"refined\" to £346m its target for 2017-18, says the National Audit Office. Some £289m was paid in 2015-16; £73m in 2012-13. \nA new \"surcharge\" for non-EU patients accounts for much of the rise, but only about half of debts owed are recovered.\nThe Department of Health said the increase showed \"very good progress\".\nNHS Trusts in England are legally obliged to check whether patients are eligible for free non-emergency NHS treatment and to recover any costs from overseas patients. \nPeople from the European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland, are usually covered by agreements such as the EHIC scheme - where their government is billed for their treatment - while those from outside the EEA are invoiced directly.\nBut the National Audit Office report estimated that only half of debts were recovered from patients from outside the EEA and found that only 58% of hospital doctors knew some people were chargeable for NHS healthcare at all.\nThe Department of Health's \"ambitious\" £500m recovery target was aimed at reducing NHS trusts' deficits, which reached £2.45bn in 2015-16.\nThat year, an extra £164m was raised from a new £200-a-year surcharge on visa applications paid by temporary migrants from outside the EEA. \nThat year also saw a 53% increase on the amount NHS trusts in England charged directly to patients, mostly to visitors from outside the EEA - much of which is thought to be due to new rules that allow hospitals to charge up to 150% of the cost of treatment, rather than a case of more people being charged. \nAnd although amounts charged to people visiting from countries within the EEA increased slightly, they remain \"well below\" the ambition to recover £200m a year by 2017-18. The latest forecast for EEA income for that period is £72m.\nThe report found some hospitals were better than others at recovering money - 10 NHS trusts in London accounted for half of the total amount charged to non-EEA patients in 2015-16. Twenty trusts said they had no patients using the EHIC scheme.\nIt praised the Department of Health for using IT systems to help trusts find patients who should be charged and for visiting 60 trusts to promote its \"cost recovery programme\", and said new financial incentives for reporting and charging overseas visitors had had an effect.\nBut it estimated that \"trusts recover around half of the amounts they charge directly to patients, mainly visitors from outside the EEA\", with recovery rates varying widely - and it was not really understood why.\nHead of the National Audit Office, Amyas Morse said: \"Hospital trusts remain some way from complying in full with the requirement to charge and recover the cost of treating overseas visitors.\"\nHe said much of the increase in amounts charged and recovered over the past two years was due to changes to charging rules: \"If current trends continue and the charging rules remain the same, the department will not achieve its ambition of recovering up to £500m of overseas visitor income a year by 2017-18.\" \nA Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"This government was the first to put in place measures to ensure the NHS isn't abused, and as this report finds, we are making very good progress - the amount of income recovered has already more than trebled in three years to £289m.\n\"We consulted earlier this year on extending the charging of migrants and visitors using the NHS to other areas of healthcare.\n\"We will set out further steps in due course to ensure we deliver on our objective to recover £500m a year by the middle of this parliament.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Organisation","GovernmentAgency"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"National Health Service

won't return to Status Quo in any performing capacity. \nThe 67-year-old had a heart attack in June and was forced to pull out of the band's autumn tour. \nThe band will only perform acoustic shows after the current tour, and Parfitt said he won't take part.  \n\"No. I don't think I really want to,\" he told Classic Rock's Dave Ling. \"In my heart I'm a rocker... If I'm going to make music it's got to rock.\"\nParfitt added: \"There would probably have been room for me if I decided I wanted to, but I'm not a great fan of the whole acoustic malarkey. It doesn't float my boat. \n\"What I am disappointed in is missing the last of the band's electric shows.\"\nBand manager Simon Porter said Parfitt \"died\" for several minutes after an attack that left him with \"mild cognitive impairments\".\nParfitt said he is now \"fully recovered\". \n\"As the weeks pass I'm better and better. I don't know whether I will be able to improve on that because I feel as well as I did when I fell over.\"\nHe has been replaced by Richie Malone in the band. Parfitt said he was doing a great job and wished him \"all the best\". \nHe added that the band have his blessing for any future plans. \nThe guitarist has had a number of health issues in recent years, including a throat cancer scare in 2005 and a heart attack in 2011.\nStatus Quo cancelled a series of gigs in 2014 after Parfitt was told to rest by doctors, following surgery to correct a problem with the quadruple heart bypass he underwent in 1997.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email .

St Kilda military site to be redeveloped","body":"New military facilities are to be built on the island of Hirta in the remote St Kilda archipelago.\nThe Ministry of the Defence (MoD) has had a tracking station on the isle since 1957.\nIt is linked to a missile range controlled from a military site on Benbecula in the Western Isles.\nThe National Trust for Scotland, which manages St Kilda along with the MoD, said the planned new buildings were \"sympathetic and sustainable\".\nSt Kilda lies about 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago.\nThe last islanders left St Kilda in 1930 and people only now live on Hirta on a temporary basis to work at the military site, or on wildlife conservation projects.\nThe MoD, working with its defence contractors QinetiQ and Skye-based architects Wittets, has submitted a planning application to Western Isles local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, for a redevelopment and environmental upgrading of its 50-year-old St Kilda facilities. \nGalliford Try International and Hugh Broughton Architects have been appointed to develop the design of the new buildings.\nNTS said the firms would be using expertise gained through building similar facilities in environments with challenging climates, including work for the British Antarctic Survey.\nLower parts of the new buildings would be \"curtained\" with stone walls designed to blend into the St Kildan landscape.\nWood panelling over the exterior walls will attain colours through weathering that will complement the surrounding scenery and roofs will be planted with native St Kildan grasses, said NTS.\nSusan Bain, the trust's property manager for St Kilda, said: \"We have been very impressed by the extent to which the MoD and its partners have gone to make sure they come up with proposals that will enhance the existing site and are both sympathetic and sustainable in the vitally important context of St Kilda.\n\"Most traces of the buildings from the 1960s will be removed and their replacements will be entirely appropriate to the setting in terms of design profile and best environmental practice.\n\"Every detail has been considered, down to ensuring that there is no chance of contaminant flora or fauna from the mainland being brought to St Kilda during the construction phase.\"\nShe added: \"The military has a long association with St Kilda going back to the First World War and we are very pleased to have worked in partnership with the MoD since 1957.  \n\"This has been entirely beneficial to our conservation activities on St Kilda and we look forward to this relationship continuing well into the future.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Island"],"matchingTokens":[1,2],"entityId":"St Kilda,

campaign’s top militia leaders Thursday afternoon in order to map out their approach before November 8. “We’re seeing tight races in Ohio and Nevada, so that’s where we need to concentrate our resources right now,” said Ron Bishop, Trump’s national militia coordinator, who ran the candidate through the various on-the-ground preparations that were being taken by the militia heads at local field offices throughout the nation, before leading the group in a brainstorming session on scenarios they might face on Election Day. “We really need to start ramping up operations in every state during these final weeks before people head to the polls. While we’ve already built dependable networks in our key strongholds in the Deep South and the West, we must prepare for the prospect of having to take action in places like Missouri and Arizona, too. We want to be as agile as possible so that we can execute a comprehensive and decisive strategy when the time comes.” At press time, Bishop was laying out a detailed plan for how Trump could take the White House.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+01:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45},{"id":1,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[7],"entityId":"Trump","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Trump","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":111,"endingPos":116},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[15],"entityId":"Militia","freebaseTypes":["/organization/organization_sector","/broadcast/radio_format"],"confidenceScore":1.603,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia","matchedText":"Militia","freebaseId":"/m/055sg","relevanceScore":0.1108,"entityEnglishId":"Militia","startingPos":160,"endingPos":167,"wikidataId":"Q153936"}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Region","AdministrativeRegion"],"matchingTokens":[0,1],"entityId":"New

Her short time at the embassy, was like \"living the pages of history\".\nWhen she arrived as an MI6 secretary, the youngest by six years, \"it was already at pretty good fever pitch\".\nMeeting the British ambassador, Humphrey Trevelyan, was \"just like being presented to royalty\", Jennifer wrote to her mother and father. \nHe was \"rather small, with sticking out ears, but still he was very charming. He informed me that I had arrived in stirring times.\"\nAt first, the \"general situation was quiet\" and throughout \"all Egyptians are charming,\" she wrote. \nA few days into her work deciphering messages, Jennifer wrote again to her parents: \"Nobody really knows what is going to happen. But underneath the surface, the atmosphere is pretty tense.\"\nEveryone feels as if they are \"doing things for the last time and therefore must get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of it\".\nJennifer explained to her parents: \"There is still no indication of which way the tide is going to turn out here. Although the tension and the work have certainly mounted and we have started burning some of the very old embassy records just in case. And what a frightful job it is, as every bit of ash has to be raked through afterwards.\"\nBut as the embassy staff shrunk and wives returned to the UK, Jennifer remembers \"playing hard\". \n\"There were nightclubs, belly dancers. We would get to bed at three o'clock in the morning and were back in the embassy at seven. I was having the time of my life.\"\n\"We got an allowance of 200 cigarettes and two bottles of spirits a month for £1. So it made entertaining quite easy.\"\n\"I was invited out to His Excellency's tent in the desert for a picnic supper,\" she wrote. \n\"Little did I dream that the first meal I would ever have with an ambassador would be sitting in the middle of the desert chewing chicken bones in one's fingers.\n\"Lady Trevelyan is now the only wife left down here. If only things would just quieten down a little, we would have the most glorious time as there are so many unattached males wandering around and just no girls! \n\"Only at the moment one might just as well have a bed in one's office. I only tell you all this just in case anyone ever feels like telling me I don't know the meaning of work!\"\nBut if not working, Jennifer says they were usually \"in the club\" having dinner with friends. \n\"In my case\", the 21-year-old wrote, \"nearly all Charlie boys from the embassy registry and a sprinkling of Dutch and American.\" \nThe fun was \"drowned only by Ms Dunk, a large spinster of uncertain age, who has just arrived from Damascus where, according to her, she was the ambassador's right-hand woman.  It is just like a gramophone record of 'I said to Sir John' or 'Sir John said to me'.\nRecalling this 60 years on, Jennifer agreed \"she was a dreadful old bag\".\nAs the crisis intensified, the ambassador was left \"out of the loop\".\nThe first thing anyone knew in the embassy of the attack by Israel was \"a telegram at quarter to one in the morning,\" Jennifer said.\nThe code over the telephone, summoning her back to the embassy in the middle of the night was: \"Shall we have a cup of tea?\"\n\"And then, 'Shall we have some friends with us?' That meant it was top secret.\"\nHaving helped the ambassador decode the telegram, he turned to her and said, \"It looks as though things are moving. You better go home as it looks as though you might be leaving soon.\"\nJennifer was told to leave with just one suitcase weighing 1st 6lb (9kg). \n\"The Swiss had volunteered to look after British assets. They're very good, the Swiss. They know what they're doing.\"\nThey were put on the last flight out of Cairo. The aircraft had four seats too few for those wanting to fly and Jennifer said she moved to the back of the queue in the hope of staying. \nHowever \"that was foiled,\" she said.\nAs they took off - quickly and \"straight up\" - an elderly American gentleman turned to her and said \"ooh gee, I hope he doesn't rush it\".\n\"I looked out of the window and there, each side of the runway, were the Egyptian tanks.\"\n\"There's no use saying I was frightened because I wasn't. The atmosphere was typically British: determinedly cheerful.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement","City"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Suez","freebaseTypes":["/location/statistical_region","/film/film_location","/location/dated_location","/location/capital_of_administrative_division","/location/citytown","/location/location"],"confidenceScore":1.024,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez","matchedText":"Suez","freebaseId":"/m/01k6hh","relevanceScore":0.05849,"entityEnglishId":"Suez","startingPos":0,"endingPos":4,"wikidataId":"Q134514"},{"id":1,"type":["Event","SocietalEvent","MilitaryConflict"],"matchingTokens":[0,1],"entityId":"Suez

matched with famous lookalikes","body":"Double-jobbing was supposed to be phased out at Stormont, but it looks as though not every MLA got the message.\nSome have been spotted posing as 1960s pop stars, dancing on TV insurance adverts and starring in comedy shows.\nBut the likes of Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness and the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) Christopher Stalford haven't given up the day job just yet.\nThey have just been paired up with their celebrity lookalikes on a new Twitter account called MLAalikes.\nThe account was set up this week by political bloggers Kris Nixon and Conor Johnston.\nThe pair are friends who both write for the Northern Ireland politics website Slugger O'Toole.\n\"We were just a bit jaded with the amount of content that goes on social media that's critical, that's constantly berating MLAs,\" Mr Nixon told BBC News NI.\nThe 29-year-old blogger said some of the material posted online about Stormont politicians is \"sometimes quite offensive\", and MLAalikes aimed to avoid that.\n\"We thought, let's just put something out there that's a little bit of fun, that both sides can laugh at,\" he said.\n\"If you see a funny picture of an MLA that's not offensive, it's not crass, it's not trying to annoy people... you're likely to give it a share.\"\n So far, there has been a positive response from some of those who have featured in the gallery.\n\"There has been some interaction from councillors and MLAs alike, and the more we do, the more we think they enjoy it,\" Mr Nixon added.\n\"They're more likely to engage if they don't feel like they're being abused.\"\nMr Stalford, a South Belfast MLA, has already featured twice - first he was compared to one of the dancers on a well-known insurance advert, and in the second instance, striking a pose reminiscent of his former party leader, Ian Paisley.\nImitation is said to be the greatest form of flattery, and the MLA seemed pleased with his DUP doppelganger as he retweeted the post.\n\"Christopher Stalford obviously engaged quite pleasantly with it,\" said Mr Nixon.\nIt can be hard to be a true original though, and the bloggers admit they were not the first to spot the DUP MLA's Twitter twin in the insurance ad.\n\"Apparently another MLA, Gary Middleton, had got there before us.\"\nSome of the matches cross the generations, with former further education minister Stephen Farry (45) likened to schoolboy Will McKenzie, one of the main characters of The Inbetweeners comedy show.\nAnd for a party that likes to stay on middle ground, the uncanny resemblance of some Alliance Party MLAs to actors from the Channel Four show does not stop there.\n\"I was at an Alliance Party event the other day where they were all laughing about it,\" said Mr Nixon.\n\"There's one of Chris Lyttle, the East Belfast MLA, and a character from The Inbetweeners which hadn't been pointed out before.\"\nThe bloggers want to reunite more MLAs who were separated at birth from their long-lost celebrity twins and are actively seeking help from Twitter users. \nHowever, not all suggestions match up to their standards.\n\"We've had a few messages in; some privately, some publicly,\" Mr Nixon said.\n\"Although, we've noticed there has been a tendency to go a little bit offensive.\n\"Some of the public ones so far, we wouldn't put up.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Work","Agent","Website","Organisation","Company"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Twitter","freebaseTypes":["/media_common/quotation_source","/business/employer","/award/award_nominated_work","/book/book_subject","/media_common/quotation_subject","/organization/organization_partnership","/business/customer","/award/award_winning_work","/internet/website"],"confidenceScore":2.035,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter","matchedText":"Twitter","freebaseId":"/m/0289n8t","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"Twitter","startingPos":0,"endingPos":7,"wikidataId":"Q918"}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Organisation","Legislature"],"matchingTokens":[8],"entityId":"Parliament

seen before. Americans are as fed up as they’ve ever been with establishment politics, the nation is confronted with the two least popular major-party nominees in modern history, and people everywhere seem hungry for a change to the status quo. As a result, there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here for a third-party candidate to present a transformative new vision for our nation and win the support of voters all across the country. And frankly, I am just as disappointed as you are to realize I am in no way qualified to do that.\nLook, I get it. I really do. I wish I were better at this too.\nWhat can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.\nThird-party candidates usually get pushed to the sidelines, where they compete for a tiny fraction of the electorate, but this year, with so many voters deeply dissatisfied with the Republican and Democratic nominees, we’re getting far more attention. As it turns out, though, being a high-profile presidential candidate requires you to do a lot of stuff you don’t have to do when you’re only pulling in 1 percent of the vote, like know all about foreign affairs and domestic policy.\nThe appearances on national television, the greater publicity given to my platform and qualifications, the chance to connect with a wider variety of voters—these are all things that would come as welcome challenges to a knowledgeable and competent candidate. But as you can probably tell by now, I am simply not up to the task. Not even close.\nWhat can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.\nI do think that I did a pretty good job as the Libertarian Party nominee last time. In 2012, hardly anyone was listening to what I had to say, so it’s not like I had to worry about being asked to explain my views on international relations or the feasibility of my tax policy or anything like that. This time around, we’ve been polling a lot better—which is great!—but it also means that I’ve had to field questions on all kinds of subjects I just don’t have any clue about. It’s actually been pretty embarrassing.\nLike a lot of you, I didn’t expect this election season to turn out the way it has. When we started out with more than 20 candidates competing for the Democratic and Republican nominations, who would have guessed that we’d end up with two nominees who are disliked and distrusted by a majority of Americans? I figured that at this point in the year, I’d be doing the typical third-party thing: you know, scraping together a couple million votes from independents and people on the ideological fringe. Instead, tens of millions of people are taking a serious look at my candidacy, which is something I clearly was not capable of dealing with. Whoops.\nIt’s frustrating, because what we have here is a great chance to show voters they have options besides the Democratic and Republican parties, which keep offering the same tired ideas we’ve tried a hundred times before. But at the same time, we have me, sitting there for yet another interview where I’m asked very basic questions about current events and blanking like an idiot. I’m not just letting myself down—I’m letting down everyone who’s looking for a credible alternative to two deeply flawed major-party nominees.\nIt sucks! I don’t know what else to tell you.\nWhat makes it really disappointing is that I truly believe libertarianism has valuable ideas to contribute to America’s political discourse. And just in general, I think it would be great to have at least one viable choice out there besides the two major parties, which on many issues, like corporate influence and federal spending, aren’t all that different. But boy oh boy, am I ever doing a shitty job of communicating all that. Voters deserve to hear about these policies from someone who can intelligently and persuasively represent them. But instead you’ve got me. Sorry.\nEven worse is that it’s probably going to be decades before any third-party candidate has a chance like this again. The two leading candidates supported a failed war that destabilized the Middle East, backed a criminal justice system that preys on racial minorities, and come with decades’ worth of personal baggage. What more could I have asked for? This is probably the best shot we’re ever going to get, and here I am wasting it for everyone.\nOh well, at least I’m not blowing it as badly as Jill Stein.\n","title_entities":[],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+01:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":4,"endingPos":8},{"id":1,"type":["Place"],"matchingTokens":[12],"entityId":"Americans","freebaseTypes":["/location/location"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Americans","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":60,"endingPos":69},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[24],"entityId":"Politics","freebaseTypes":["/film/film_subject","/media_common/literary_genre","/media_common/media_genre","/organization/organization_sector","/radio/radio_subject","/book/magazine_genre","/comic_strips/comic_strip_genre","/award/award_discipline","/tv/tv_subject","/theater/theater_genre","/media_common/quotation_subject","/book/periodical_subject","/broadcast/genre","/people/professional_field","/internet/website_category","/comic_books/comic_book_genre","/education/field_of_study","/tv/tv_genre","/book/book_subject","/film/film_genre"],"confidenceScore":1.743,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics","matchedText":"politics","freebaseId":"/m/05qt0","relevanceScore":0.4322,"entityEnglishId":"Politics","startingPos":124,"endingPos":132,"wikidataId":"Q7163"},{"id":3,"matchingTokens":[51,52],"entityId":"Status

everyone else heads to the polls next month. “I know I want to spend seven days fishing for compliments about doing my civic duty, so why not get it done with right away? It’s always such a pain to pedantically slip some of the names of the down-ballot candidates into conversations on the same day as everyone else, so it’s great to have this option.” Keene told reporters that he loved how easy his early voting location made it to complain about being tired because he had voted this morning before work.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+01:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[13],"entityId":"Ballot","confidenceScore":1.346,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot","matchedText":"ballot","freebaseId":"/m/01bgz0","relevanceScore":0.2402,"entityEnglishId":"Ballot","startingPos":65,"endingPos":71,"wikidataId":"Q905151"},{"id":1,"type":["Number"],"matchingTokens":[22],"entityId":"8","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"8","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":111,"endingPos":112,"unit":"Number"},{"id":2,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[26,27],"entityId":"David Keene","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"David Keene","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":124,"endingPos":135},{"id":3,"type":["Number"],"matchingTokens":[29],"entityId":"36","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"36","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":137,"endingPos":139,"unit":"Number"},{"id":4,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[34],"entityId":"2016-11-03T00:00:00.000+01:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Thursday","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":164,"endingPos":172},{"id":5,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement","City"],"matchingTokens":[0,1,2],"entityId":"Scottsdale, Arizona","freebaseTypes":["/location/location","/government/governmental_jurisdiction","/location/citytown","/film/film_location","/location/statistical_region","/organization/organization_scope","/location/hud_foreclosure_area","/location/dated_location","/location/hud_county_place","/travel/travel_destination"],"confidenceScore":2.25,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona","matchedText":"SCOTTSDALE, AZ","freebaseId":"/m/0qpqn","relevanceScore":0.1518,"entityEnglishId":"Scottsdale, Arizona","startingPos":0,"endingPos":14,"wikidataId":"Q49221"},{"id":6,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[99],"entityId":"Keene","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Keene","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":451,"endingPos":456},{"id":7,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[115,116],"entityId":"I Voted","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"I Voted","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":532,"endingPos":539},{"id":8,"matchingTokens":[128],"entityId":"Ballot","confidenceScore":1.346,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot","matchedText":"ballot","freebaseId":"/m/01bgz0","relevanceScore":0.2402,"entityEnglishId":"Ballot","startingPos":598,"endingPos":604,"wikidataId":"Q905151"},{"id":9,"type":["Work","Agent","Website","Organisation","Company"],"matchingTokens":[130],"entityId":"Facebook","freebaseTypes":["/business/brand","/film/film_subject","/book/book_subject","/internet/website","/internet/api","/award/award_winning_work","/media_common/quotation_source","/award/award_nominated_work","/computer/programming_language_developer","/dataworld/attribution_template"],"confidenceScore":4.247,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook","matchedText":"Facebook","freebaseId":"/m/02y1vz","relevanceScore":0.3645,"entityEnglishId":"Facebook","startingPos":608,"endingPos":616,"wikidataId":"Q355"},{"id":10,"type":["Duration"],"matchingTokens":[148,149],"entityId":"7","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"seven days","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":693,"endingPos":703,"unit":"day"},{"id":11,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[206],"entityId":"Keene","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Keene","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":977,"endingPos":982},{"id":12,"matchingTokens":[215,216],"entityId":"Early voting","confidenceScore":1.712,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting","matchedText":"early voting","freebaseId":"/m/04l0mh","relevanceScore":0.3809,"entityEnglishId":"Early voting","startingPos":1025,"endingPos":1037,"wikidataId":"Q708369"}]},{"title":"Syrian refugees: 'We want to start our new lives in UK'","body":"A Syrian refugee family were offered the chance of a new life in Britain - but a year later, they remain homeless in Lebanon. They told the BBC about how their dreams have turned to frustration.\nMohammad Ameen used to run a computer repair shop in Homs. He had his own home and car. He says he had a peaceful life.\nBut like millions of others, he was caught up in the war in Syria. \nAfter being held in a regime jail for over a year, he fled to Lebanon with his family in August 2012 \nSyrian refugees in Lebanon are not allowed to work, and there are no formal settlements for them. Instead, they must find their own accommodation, and live on the small stipend the United Nations High Commissioner For Refugees (UNHCR) provides. \nHe and his family moved from rented flat to rented flat, often having to pay expensive rent, and gradually selling all their belongings. \nThen last year, they were given new hope. \nThey had been selected - through the UNHCR - to go to the UK as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme. \n\"We were so happy when we learnt we will be able to travel to the UK,\" he says.\n\"All of us got so excited. We started picturing how life would be there - with a big furnished house and not being banned from going to work. We were so happy. \"\nHe and his family went through all the medical and security tests required - a process that takes months. \nBut the night before their flight last September, he got a call - their seats on the plane had been cancelled. \n\"I asked why? They said it's because your name matches a name on a wanted list. But this isn't possible. I'm here, I'm registered, I'm not going anywhere. They can come and arrest me if they want. It wasn't me on that list - it's a mistaken identity.\"\nHe adds: \"The cancellation was a major blow to us.\"\nMohammad says Lebanese security admitted their administrative error, and he then had to go through the UN medical and security vetting process again. \nA second date was scheduled for August 2016 for a flight to the UK. \nHowever, the flight was cancelled for a second time.\nMohammad's wife Ahad explained how the family took the news. \n\"When it was cancelled for a second time, Omar our youngest took it particularly hard,\" she said. \n\"He wants a new bike. All he does is dream about riding a new bike. It's hard for us. But for them, it's awful, because they feel like their lives are waiting to start.\"\nShe continued: \"It's been even more difficult because when we got on to the scheme the first time, we stopped receiving aid because we were meant to travel. It was never restarted. That money keeps us alive.\"\nSo now Mohammad and his family have been living for over a year without the UN stipend they were getting, waiting for word on whether they'll get to start their new lives. \nMohammad feels that while many refugees try and make their own way to the UK, he's been playing by the rules - and his family has been let down. \nThe BBC asked repeatedly for comment from the British embassy in Beirut and from the Home Office in the UK. \nThey sent us this statement. \n\"The UK has been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. \n\"We have committed to resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees through our Vulnerable Persons Resettlement (VPR) scheme over the course of this parliament and are on track to meet this landmark commitment. So far, we have provided refuge to more than 2,800 people in need of protection.\n\"Not all referrals from the UNHCR lead to resettlement in the UK. This is for a range of reasons, including refugees choosing to withdraw and problems obtaining exit permissions from their current country of residence. \n\"Furthermore the Home Office retains the right to reject individuals on security, war crimes or other grounds.\n\"The decision whether or not to grant exit permission is a matter for the host country. Where an individual is denied exit permission we will work with the host government and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to establish the reasons, and resolve any issues if we are able.\"\nIt may be a decision for the host country, but Mohammad feels he's been abandoned by a system which was meant to help him. He doesn't understand why the UK didn't make more of an effort to get him cleared. \nMatthew Saltmarsh, from the UNHCR, says Lebanese security will not explain what the hold-up has been, although he admits there was an issue with the family's food allowance. \nBut he was supportive of UK efforts. \n\"The UK has been very co-operative,\" he said, \"and they're very organised when it comes to relocating refugees. They've pledged to take 20,000 over the next five years and they are on track to meet that pledge.\"\nThe British government has faced criticism for accepting a smaller number of refugees on their scheme than other developed nations. Canada and Germany have pledged to take far more, although France is well behind. \nFor Mohammad, the delays mean his children have been out of school even longer than they otherwise would. \n\"The one next to you still can't write his name,\" he says, pointing to his 10-year-old son. \n\"They don't teach them here. I just want to go to the UK for my children.\"

the Federal Election Commission announced Thursday it would be extending the U.S. presidential election by seven months to give Americans the opportunity to better get to know the presidential candidates. “We believe the continuation of this election by just over half a year will provide Americans with the chance to fully acquaint themselves with both the character and policy positions of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump,” said FEC chairman Matthew S. Petersen, who expressed confidence that the American people would benefit greatly from over 200 extra days of election coverage, rallies, press conferences, and campaign ads. “Our commission has also worked with the CPD to schedule eight more presidential debates and three more town halls, so that there will be no question that every citizen is ready to cast their ballot by the time Election Day comes around on June 8, 2017.” The FEC added that it had not ruled out extending the election by an additional year if any U.S. voters were still undecided.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+01:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45},{"id":1,"type":["Company"],"matchingTokens":[7],"entityId":"FEC","freebaseTypes":["/organization/organization"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"FEC","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":111,"endingPos":114},{"id":2,"type":["Duration"],"matchingTokens":[11,12],"entityId":"7","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"7

rebels launch Aleppo counter-attack to break siege","body":"BEIRUT Syrian rebels including jihadists began a counter-attack against the army and its allies on Friday aiming to break a weeks-long siege on eastern Aleppo, insurgents said.\nThe assault, employing heavy shelling and suicide car bombs, was mainly focused on the city's western edge by rebels based outside Aleppo. It included Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, a former affiliate of al Qaeda previously known as the Nusra Front, and groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army banner. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, said more than 15 civilians had been killed and 100 wounded by rebel shelling of government-held western Aleppo. State media reported that five civilians were killed.\nThere were conflicting accounts of advances in areas on the city's outskirts.\nAleppo, Syria's biggest pre-war city, has become the main theater of conflict between President Bashar al-Assad backed by Iran, Russia and Shi'ite militias, and Sunni rebels including groups supported by Turkey, Gulf monarchies and the United States. \nThe city has been divided for years between the government-held western sector and rebel-held east, which the army and its allies put under siege this summer and where they launched a new offensive in September that medics say has killed hundreds. \nPhotographs showed insurgents approaching Aleppo in tanks, armored vehicles, bulldozers, make-shift mine sweepers, pick-up trucks and on motorcycles, and showed a large column of smoke rising in the distance after an explosion.\nRebels said they had taken several positions from government forces. But a Syrian military source said the attack on the western side of the city had been thwarted. A state television station reported that the army had destroyed four car bombs.\nAbu Anas al-Shami, a member of the Fateh al-Sham media office, told Reuters from Syria the group had carried out two \"martyrdom operations\", after which its fighters had gone in and had been able to \"liberate a number of important areas\". A third such attack had been carried out by another Islamist group.\nA senior official in the Levant Front, a Free Syrian Army (FSA) group, said: \"There is a general call-up for anyone who can bear arms.\"\n\"The preparatory shelling started this morning,\" he added.           \nHeavy rebel bombardment, with more than 150 rockets and shells, struck southwestern districts, the Observatory said.\n\nJIHADIST GROUPS \nFateh al-Sham played a big part in a rebel attack in July that managed to break the government siege on eastern Aleppo for several weeks before it was reimposed.\nAbu Youssef al-Mouhajir, an official from the powerful Ahrar al-Sham Islamist group, said the extent of cooperation between the different rebel factions was unusual, and that the largest axis of attack was on the western edge of the city. \n\"This long axis disperses the enemy and it provides us with good cover in the sense that the enemy's attacks are not focused,\" he said.\nThe powerful role played by Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, listed by many countries as a terrorist group, has complicated Western policy towards supporting the anti-Assad opposition.\nThe United States has prevented more powerful weapons such as anti-aircraft missiles from being supplied to rebels partly out of fear they could end up in jihadist hands.\nSyria's civil war, now in its sixth year, has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the country's pre-war population, dragged in regional and global powers and caused a refugee crisis in the Middle East and Europe.\nGrad rockets were launched at Aleppo's Nairab air base before the assault began said Zakaria Malahiji, head of the political office of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim rebel group, adding that it was going to be \"a big battle\".  \nThe

rejected at the High Court in Belfast.\nTwo separate proceedings, one by a cross-party group of MLAs and another from victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, were heard earlier this month.\nA judge ruled there was nothing in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement to prevent the government triggering Article 50, the formal legal process for leaving the EU.\nThe UK government welcomed the ruling.\nThe challenge by politicians from Sinn Féin, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Alliance Party and the Green Party suggested the UK government could not trigger Article 50 without a parliamentary vote.\nThey said the Brexit decision should be examined and voted on by parliament or, failing that, by the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nEarlier this month, the High Court in London heard that the need for parliament to give its approval before the Brexit process starts is of huge \"constitutional importance\".\nMr McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries and who now campaigns for victims of violence during Northern Ireland's Troubles, brought the other legal bid.\nHis legal challenge came amid worries that the Brexit vote could mean an end to EU funding for peace projects that help Troubles victims in Northern Ireland.\nHis lawyer argued that the Good Friday Agreement meant Westminster had given sovereignty of Northern Ireland over to its people, and that leaving the EU would have a \"catastrophic effect\" for the peace process.\nMajor constitutional changes such as leaving the EU could not therefore be imposed by a Westminster government, Mr McCord's barrister said.\nBut Mr Justice Maguire ruled that prerogative power could still be used, arguing that triggering Article 50 is merely the start of a legislative process in which acts of parliament will be necessary.\n\"While the wind of change may be about to blow, the precise direction in which it will blows cannot be determined,\" he said.\nHe concluded that discussing the use of prerogative power to enact the EU referendum result was not suitable for a judicial review.\nIt had also been argued that the Good Friday Agreement gave the power of sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland and that the Westminster government could not therefore make Northern Ireland leave the EU.\nBut Mr Justice Maguire rejected this argument as well, saying he could not see anything in the agreement or the relevant legislation that confirmed the view of the applicant.\nThus all the issues raised by the applicants were rejected by the court.\nWelcoming the ruling, a government spokesman said: \"As we have always made clear, we stand by our commitments under the Belfast Agreement and the outcome of the EU referendum doesn't change this. \nThe case has been closely watched by Westminster, especially as similar hearings are due for judgement in the near future.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement","City"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Belfast","freebaseTypes":["/organization/organization_scope","/location/capital_of_administrative_division","/location/location","/location/statistical_region","/government/governmental_jurisdiction","/location/dated_location","/location/place_with_neighborhoods","/location/citytown","/business/employer","/periodicals/newspaper_circulation_area","/business/business_location","/travel/travel_destination","/location/administrative_division"],"confidenceScore":2.025,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast","matchedText":"Belfast","freebaseId":"/m/01l63","relevanceScore":0.02893,"entityEnglishId":"Belfast","startingPos":0,"endingPos":7,"wikidataId":"Q10686"},{"id":1,"type":["Company"],"matchingTokens":[0,1,2],"entityId":"Belfast

they would launch an offensive against Islamic State west of Mosul imminently, a move which would block any retreat by the Sunni jihadists into Syria but is likely to alarm Iraq's northern neighbor Turkey.\nA spokesman for the Iranian-backed paramilitary groups said the advance toward the Islamic State-held town of Tal Afar, about 55 km (35 miles) west of Mosul, would start within \"a few days or hours\".\nIf successful, the offensive would leave Islamic State fighters - and the 1.5 million civilians still living in Mosul -  encircled by an advancing coalition of forces which seeks to crush the hardline Sunni militants in their Iraq stronghold.\nIraqi soldiers and security forces and Kurdish peshmerga fighters, backed by U.S.-led air strikes and support on the ground, already control Mosul's southern, eastern and northern flanks, and have advanced on those fronts for nearly two weeks.\nThey have recaptured scores of villages on the flat plains east of Mosul and along the Tigris river to the south, but the battle for Mosul itself, Iraq's second largest city, could be the most complex military operation in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion to topple former president Saddam Hussein in 2003.\nAdding to the challenges facing the advancing forces, retreating Islamic State fighters have forced women and children from outlying villages to march alongside them as human shields as they withdraw into the city, according to villagers who spoke to Reuters by telephone from Mosul.\nOlder boys and men of fighting age were taken off to an unknown fate, they said.\nThe United Nations said on Friday Islamic State had abducted 8,000 families from around Mosul to use as human shields. A spokeswoman also said they had killed 232 people near Mosul on Wednesday who refused to comply with orders.\n\nCUTTING LINES TO SYRIA\nAhmed al-Asadi, a spokesman for the Shi'ite forces known collectively as the Hashid Shaabi, or Popular Mobilisation, said the operation to cut off Mosul's western approaches was crucial to the battle against Islamic State, also known as Daesh.\n\"This is the most important and dangerous line because it connects Mosul to Raqqa and is the only supply line for Daesh,\" he told Iraqi state television.\nRaqqa is Islamic State's bastion in Syria, and the two cities form the symbolic capitals of a cross-border \"caliphate\" declared by its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from the pulpit of a Mosul mosque in August 2014.\nIraqi and military sources say there has been a debate about whether or not to close off the western route in and out of Mosul. Leaving it open would offer Islamic State fighters a chance to retreat, potentially sparing civilians inside the city who might otherwise be trapped in a bloody fight to the finish.\nSome civilians fleeing Mosul have used the roads to the west to escape to Qamishli, in Kurdish-controlled northern Syria. \nJust as the advancing army and peshmerga forces have had to battle to recapture even small villages on the road to Mosul, facing waves of roadside bombings, sniper fire and suicide car bombs, Asadi suggested the advance on Tal Afar may take time.\nIt will be launched from the Qayyara military base, about 90 km (55 miles) to the southeast.\n\"Tal Afar is the final destination ... it is the pyramid’s peak. But there are villages in the way that need to be liberated before reaching Tal Afar,\" Asadi said.\n\nTURKISH WARNING\nThe Tal Afar offensive will target an area which is close to Turkey and home to a sizeable population of ethnic Turkmen, with historic cultural ties to Turkey.\n Turkey fears the use of the Shi'ite militias in the Mosul campaign will lead to sectarian strife in the mainly Sunni region and exacerbate an expected exodus of refugees.\nTurkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said this week his country, which has troops deployed north of Mosul inside Iraqi territory, will take measures if there is an attack on Tal Afar.\nThe population of Tal Afar was mix of Sunni and Shi'ite ethnic Turkmen until Shi'ites fled the town after Islamic State's takeover two years ago.\nEarlier announcements by the Shi'ite militias that they will be involved in the offensive on Mosul, Islamic State's last major stronghold in Iraq, triggered warnings from human rights groups of sectarian violence in the mainly Sunni province.\nShi'ites make up a majority in Iraq but Sunnis are predominant in the north and the west.\nThe Popular Mobilisation forces, formed in 2014 to help halt Islamic State's sweep through Iraq's northern and western provinces, are backed by Iran although they officially report to the Shi'ite-led government of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.\nAmnesty International says that in previous campaigns, the Shi'ite militias have committed \"serious human rights violations, including war crimes\" against civilians fleeing Islamic State-held territory.\nThe U.N in July said it had a list of more than 640 Sunni Muslim men and boys reportedly abducted by a Shi'ite militia in Falluja, west of Baghdad, and about 50 others who were summarily executed or tortured to death.\nThe government and the Popular Mobilisation forces say a limited number of violations had occurred and were investigated, but they deny abuses were widespread and systematic.\n\n (Writing by

alert and pay close attention to every individual who arrives at their voting location, the “Trump Election Observer” section of Donald Trump’s campaign website reportedly trains supporters to spot any suspicious skin colors they may see on Election Day, sources confirmed this week. “Keep an eye out for any of the skin tones appearing on the list below, none of which are allowable on November 8,” read the webpage in part, reminding volunteers that watching out for certain suspect and disreputable complexions was the only way to ensure the Republican nominee had a fair shot at winning the election. “Be on the lookout for these two shades in particular, as they have historically proven to cause significant trouble. And remember that whenever you spot a dubious-looking skin pigmentation at your polling place, immediately confront the problem head-on.” The site further stated that should a volunteer happen to notice a significantly high number of suspicious skin colors at their precinct, they should call their local Trump field office immediately so the campaign could formally contest the polling location’s results.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000+01:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45},{"id":1,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[7],"entityId":"Trump","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Trump","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":111,"endingPos":116}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Company"],"matchingTokens":[25,26,27],"entityId":"Trump

attacks Clinton on trade, says he should be handed victory","body":"TOLEDO, Ohio; WINSTON SALEM, N.C. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday over her trade policies, saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should \"just cancel the election\" and name him the victor. \nSpeaking to supporters in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, had led to the outsourcing of thousands of Ohio jobs to Mexico, a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on Nov. 8.\n\"We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right?\" he said. \"What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad.\"\nTrump said he believed Clinton would seek passage of the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership, President Barack Obama's signature Asian trade deal, which she now opposes.\nTrump's remarks came as the New York businessman tries to steady rocky poll numbers amid a series of controversies and self-inflicted wounds. \nHe has struggled to handle the fallout from the release of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" video that showed the then-reality TV star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.\nTrump said on Thursday it was \"certainly illegal\" for NBC to release the tape and he left open the option of seeking legal action against the network after the election.\nSince the video's release, a series of women have accused Trump of groping them or kissing them without their consent. Trump has called the allegations \"absolutely false.\"\nThe latest RealClearPolitics poll average showed Clinton with a nearly 6-point national lead over Trump, fueled by declining support among women for his candidacy.\nTrump, without evidence, has blamed his sagging poll numbers on a rigged election, and said the media had fixed the opinion polls in order to inflate Clinton's numbers.\nNumerous studies have shown that voter fraud in U.S. elections is very rare, and a number of prominent Republicans have denounced Trump's claim that the system is unsound.\nWhile Trump campaigned in  Ohio, a plane carrying his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, skidded off the runway after landing at New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Thursday night. There were no injuries, the Pence campaign said.\n\nSTUMPING WITH FIRST LADY\nClinton on Thursday made her first joint campaign appearance with one of her most powerful supporters, first lady Michelle Obama, at a North Carolina rally to urge young people and women to vote.\nClinton, a former first lady who lost the 2008 Democratic nomination to then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama before becoming his secretary of state, praised Michelle Obama for standing up for the rights of girls and women worldwide, drawing a sharp contrast with her Republican rival.\n\"I wish I didn't have to say this. ... But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election,\" Clinton told a crowd of about 11,000. \"And I want to thank our first lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.\"\nMichelle Obama's stinging denunciation of Trump after a leaked 2005 video showed him making lewd remarks and bragging about groping women was seen by many as one of the campaign's most striking condemnations of the New York businessman.\nWithout naming Trump, Obama took him to task again in North Carolina, asking the crowd which candidate they wanted to represent their daughters from the White House.\n\"We want a president who takes this job seriously, and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes,\" Obama said. \n\"I would not be here lying to you: I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that president,\" she said.\nAlthough Michelle Obama was critical of Clinton during the hard-fought 2008 Democratic nominating race, any trace of bitterness appeared long behind them. The two women showed an easy rapport. They embraced and smiled. Obama called Clinton \"my girl\" and made a point of telling the crowd they were tight.\n\"If people wonder: Yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend,\" she said.\nClinton promised to take good care of Obama's White House vegetable garden if she won and wistfully praised the athletic first lady's dancing skills. \"One could only hope,\" Clinton said.\nShe also lauded Obama's work for children and military families and in what was perhaps a nod to African-Americans she hopes will vote for her in the state, said Obama had faced challenges she had not as a presidential spouse.\n\"Let's be real. As our first African-American first lady, she's faced pressures I never did, and she's handled them with pure grace,\" Clinton said to applause.\nAlthough a sometimes reluctant campaigner, the first lady has thrown herself into the race, and the Clinton campaign has deployed her strategically to increase support among young people and blacks, with whom she is especially popular.\n\n\n\n (Writing

Currently In Hand\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"BOULDER, CO—Saying such feelings of desire were observed in nearly every individual they studied, psychologists from the University of Colorado released a report Thursday concluding that it is perfectly natural for people to fantasize about sandwiches other than the one presently in their hands.\nThe study, which surveyed more than 500 adults from a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, determined that 89 percent of subjects had, at least once during the previous six months, vividly imagined a different sandwich while sitting down at the table with their current hero, hoagie, or po’ boy.\n“While many people may find it distressing or shameful when they begin mentally picturing a sandwich that’s nothing like the one they are holding, our findings suggest that these thoughts are, in fact, a completely normal biological impulse,” said Dr. Kelly Sohn, the report’s lead author. “You should by no means feel any sense of regret or embarrassment if you suddenly find yourself mid-bite feeling curious about a particularly striking BLT that caught your eye while you were walking by a café earlier that day or letting your thoughts drift to a pastrami on rye you used to have in college.”\n“Even if you’re completely satisfied with the sandwich sitting right in front of you, it is purely an instinctual response to become overwhelmed by a strong desire to taste one that’s very different,” Sohn added. “It’s just human nature.”\nAccording to the research team, it is particularly common for individuals to indulge in fantasies about exotic sandwiches from foreign culinary traditions, like Cubans or Vietnamese bánh mìs, that they have never tried before. Additionally, Sohn said that many subjects reported finding themselves particularly drawn to bigger, beefier sandwiches or those with larger meatballs, often causing them to imagine these alluring features on their own, plainer sandwich when they later sit down for a meal.\nResearchers also explained that, on average, a person imagines a different sandwich than the one they’re currently holding about once every week, though a sizable minority of respondents reportedly acknowledged engaging in such fantasies every single time they had lunch.\n“It’s important to remember that mentally picturing a piled-high Reuben when you’re eating the same chicken salad sandwich you always get is by and large the product of reflexive brain activity over which you have very little control,” said Sohn, adding that Americans are constantly bombarded with images of picture-perfect subs and idealized pulled pork sandwiches on billboards and television, further explaining the ubiquity of the phenomenon. “In fact, we found that when people are able to unlearn the guilt that is often associated with these harmless fantasies, it can actually make the enjoyment of one’s own sandwich that much more satisfying.”\n“The real danger lies in unnecessarily punishing oneself for these thoughts, which can eventually diminish the gratification one derives from eating sandwiches altogether,” she continued.\nSohn further assured the public that it was normal for such fantasies to become extremely vivid and complex. In particular, she noted that 63 percent of subjects had reported that on one or more occasions, they had imagined themselves eating their desired sandwich in an uncommon location, such as in a car, aboard a plane, or even in front of other people in public.\nExperts also confirmed that more atypical fantasies, such as eating a sandwich in a hot tub or devouring two sandwiches at once, were, in most cases, perfectly normal as well.\n“It’s such a relief to know I’m not some weirdo or a bad person for checking out my brother’s spicy Italian when we went out to lunch a few weeks ago—I felt so guilty about that,” said 42-year-old study participant Craig Worsley, who told reporters he couldn’t help but imagine sinking his teeth into the sandwich’s thick layers of salami, capicola, and provolone until tangy vinaigrette dribbled all down his chin. “Don’t get me wrong, I liked the patty melt I ordered just fine, but man, I looked at his sandwich and couldn’t help but think, ‘Damn, that thing is stacked.’”\nAdded Worsley, “But now I understand I’m just like any other person out there with a normal, healthy appetite.”\nResearchers stated that a small percentage of deeply troubled individuals reported fantasizing about salads while eating their sandwiches, and recommended that anyone experiencing these types of perverse, abnormal thoughts immediately seek psychological counseling.\n","title_entities":[],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Company"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"BOULDER","freebaseTypes":["/organization/organization"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"BOULDER","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":0,"endingPos":7},{"id":1,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement","City"],"matchingTokens":[0,1,2],"entityId":"Boulder,

southern Hambantota port to Chinese firm","body":"COLOMBO Sri Lanka will sell to a Chinese company 80 percent of a $1.5-billion port in its south, where China has also been offered an investment zone, in a bid to cut the country's debt burden, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said. \nThe move follows an offer made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe during a visit to China in April, to swap equity in Sri Lankan infrastructure projects against some of the $8 billion in debt the Indian Ocean island owes to China.\nThe Hambantota port was built with the help of Chinese loans and contractors in 2010 under former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, as part of efforts to boost development of infrastructure after the conclusion of a 26-year-long civil war in 2009. \nBut the port, and a nearby airport, also Chinese-financed, had been seen as a white elephant because it was not financially viable, the current government has said.\n\"For somebody like the Chinese, it is the silk route transit point,\" Karunanayake told a meeting of the country's Foreign Correspondents Association late on Thursday.\nChina's interest in the port is seen as part of its ambitions to build a \"Maritime Silk Route\" to the oil-rich Middle East and onwards to Europe.\nThat makes some countries, including India and the United States, nervous, with Sri Lanka sitting near shipping lanes through which much of the world's trade passes en route to China and Japan.\n\"The value will be more than $1 billion and the deal will be signed around the second week of November,\" Karunanayake said, adding that a Chinese port operator would get 80 percent of the port stake. He declined to identify the company involved. \n\"The money from the deal will be used to repay expensive foreign loans,\" Karunanayake said, adding that the government was also in final talks over a 15,000-acre (6,100-hectare) investment zone near the port.\nThe investment zone deal would be signed as \"soon as possible\", Karunanayake said.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena suspended most of the Chinese infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, including a $1.4-billion luxury property deal, allegedly because the proper procedure had not been followed, or costs had been inflated under his predecessor.\nHowever, faced with a debt and balance-of-payments crisis, the new government eventually allowed all the projects to go ahead.\n\n (Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Clarence

worst sleepers in the world, according to a survey.\nIn the survey of 1,000 people aged 18 and over, more than a third (37%) of Britons said they did not get the right amount of sleep.\nPeople in India scored the best in the survey, carried out by Aviva, with 9%.\nTwenty-nine per cent of families said they prioritised improving their sleep over reducing sugar intake and eating more healthily.\nThe survey of 13 countries also found that 25% of Britons list getting a better night's sleep as a priority.\nIt is the second most common health ambition, beaten only by wanting to lose weight or improve BMI.\nOnly half (51%) of parents said they ensure their children get the right amount of sleep with 49% admitting to using going to bed later as a reward for their children.\nDr Doug Wright, Medical Director for Aviva UK Health said people feeling like they are running on empty were \"not alone\".\nHe said: \"The importance of getting a decent night's sleep should never be underestimated. Sleep plays an important role in mental and physical health, with your body using this time to renew and repair.\"\nTips to boost sleep

Universe beauty contest.\nNinni Laaksonen told the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper that the  Republican presidential nominee had grabbed her behind before she appeared on a television show in New York with other contestants.\n\"He really grabbed my butt. I don't think anybody saw it but I flinched and thought: 'What is happening?',\" Laaksonen was quoted as saying in the newspaper.\nThe accusation follows a stream of allegations of inappropriate conduct by Trump from other women in the United States which have put pressure on his campaign as he trails in  opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Trump has denied the accusations.\nLaaksonen could not be reached for comment on Friday.\n\n\n (Reporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Angus

Friday ahead of Exxon and Chevron's quarterly earnings and a report on gross domestic product. \nThe U.S. Commerce Department issues the first estimate of GDP for the third quarter at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report is likely to show that the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.5 percent rate.\nThe University of Michigan will release its final reading of the consumer sentiment index, which likely rose to 88.1 in October.  \nWhile the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise rates at its policy meeting next week, analysts expect the central bank to offer more clues on a potential rate hike in December.\nTraders have priced in a mere 8 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's November meeting and a 78.3 percent chance of a move in December, according to data from CME Group.  \nThe dollar was hovering close to an 11-week high, while oil prices were marginally lower. [O/R]\nInvestors will continue to assess corporate earnings in the hope that the third quarter marks the end of a year-long earnings recession as more companies beat expectations. \nProfits at S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 2.6 percent, helped largely by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, energy companies are expected to take a hit. \nWall Street slipped in choppy trading on Thursday as a decline in the consumer discretionary sector and interest-rate sensitive stocks outweighed gains in healthcare names.\nAmazon.com (AMZN.O) shares are on track to open at a more than two month low, falling 4.4 percent at $782.50 after the online retailer warned that heavy investment would drag on profits in the holiday quarter.\nGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) was up 1.2 percent to $827 after the company's third-quarter revenue and profit beat analysts' expectations.\nDrug distributor McKesson (MCK.N) plunged 13.1 to $139.50 percent, taking down peer Cardinal Health (CAH.N), after reporting a revenue in the second quarter that missed expectations.\nBaker Hughes (BHI.N) rose 6.8 percent to $58.26 after GE (GE.N) said it was in discussion with the oilfield services provider on potential partnerships.\n\nFutures snapshot at 6:59 a.m.

militants acquitted of conspiracy in wildlife refuge seizure","body":"PORTLAND, Ore. A federal court jury delivered a surprise verdict on Thursday acquitting anti-government militant leader Ammon Bundy and six followers of conspiracy charges stemming from their role in the armed takeover of a wildlife center in Oregon earlier this year.\nThe outcome marked a stinging defeat for federal prosecutors and law enforcement in a trial the defendants sought to turn into a pulpit for airing their opposition to U.S. government control over millions of acres of public lands in the West.\nBundy and others, including his brother and co-defendant Ryan Bundy, cast the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a patriotic act of civil disobedience. Prosecutors called it a lawless scheme to seize federal property by force.\nJubilant supporters of the Bundys thronged the courthouse after the verdict, hailing the trial's outcome as vindication of a political ideology that is profoundly distrustful of federal authority and challenges its legitimacy.\n\"We're so grateful to the jurors who weren't swayed by the nonsense that was going on,\" defendant Shawna Cox told reporters. \"God said we weren't guilty. We weren't guilty of anything.\"\nAs the seven-week-long trial in the U.S. District Court in Portland climaxed, U.S. marshals wrestled to the floor Ammon Bundy's lawyer, Marcus Mumford, as he argued heatedly with the judge over the terms of his client's continued detention.\nThe Bundys still face assault, conspiracy and other charges from a separate armed standoff in 2014 at the Nevada ranch of their father, Cliven Bundy, triggered when federal agents seized his cattle for his failure to pay grazing fees for his use of public land.\nThe outcome of the Oregon trial clearly shocked many in the packed courtroom. Attorneys exchanged looks of astonishment with the defendants, then hugged their clients as the not-guilty verdicts were read amid gasps from spectators.\nOutside the courthouse, supporters celebrated by shouting \"Hallelujah\" and reading passages from the U.S. Constitution. One man rode his horse, named Lady Liberty, in front of the courthouse carrying an American flag.\nThe verdict came after four days of deliberations. One juror, a former federal employee, was dismissed over questions of bias on Wednesday and replaced by a substitute.\nThe 12-member panel found all seven defendants - six men and a woman - not guilty of the most serious charge, conspiracy to impede federal officers through intimidation, threats or force. That charge alone carried a maximum penalty of six years in prison.\nThe defendants also were acquitted of illegal possession of firearms in a federal facility and theft of government property, except in the case of Ryan Bundy, for whom jurors were deadlocked on the charge of theft.\nThe takeover of the wildlife refuge was initially sparked by outrage over the plight of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers the occupiers believed had been unfairly treated in an arson case. But the militants said they were also protesting larger grievances at what they saw as government tyranny.\nThe standoff led to the shooting death of one protester, Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum, by police shortly after the Bundy brothers were arrested, and left parts of the refuge badly damaged.\nMore than two dozen people, in all, have been criminally charged in the occupation, and a second group of defendants is due to stand trial in February.\nMumford told reporters he believed Ammon and Ryan Bundy would remain in custody for the time being but may be transferred to Nevada. \nFour co-defendants were free on their own recognizance during the trial. A fifth, David Fry, the last of the occupiers to surrender in February, was released hours after the verdict.\n\n (Reporting by Scott Bransford in Portland; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Cynthia

on Friday rejected an attempt to block Britain's exit from the European Union, saying that neither the province's parliament nor laws could override a decision by the British government. \nBut it said it would defer to English courts on the wider issue of whether the British government has the right to invoke Article 50 of the EU Lisbon Treaty to leave the bloc, without the explicit backing of the British parliament.\nPrime Minister Theresa May welcomed the ruling, with a spokesman saying it would allow the British government \"to proceed to trigger Article 50 as planned\".\nOne of the plaintiffs, human rights activists Raymond McCord, said he would appeal against the ruling in the Supreme Court, Britain's highest judicial body. \nThe case is the first judgment in legal disputes around Brexit that are being closely watched by politicians and markets. A case in London will rule on whether May can use the  government's \"royal prerogative\" power to trigger Article 50 without consulting parliament.\n\"The fact that the government has won in the Northern Ireland case could be seen to indicate that its prerogative power is holding up pretty well,\" said Stephen Tierney, director of the Edinburgh Centre for Constitutional Law. \n\"I would personally be surprised if the High Court in England reached a different conclusion,\" he said. \n\nSTERLING DIPS\nSterling hit an eight-day low against the euro after the ruling. \nOverall, 52 percent of the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU in June's referendum, but 56 percent of those voting in Northern Ireland backed remaining in the bloc. \nThere are fears that Brexit could undermine a 1998 peace deal, the Good Friday Agreement, which ended three decades of bloodshed in the province, and could lead to the reintroduction of unpopular controls on the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nBut justice Paul Maguire said it was \"not viable\" that Northern Ireland should overrule the 52 percent of the United Kingdom as a whole that voted in favor of leaving. \nThe regional parliament would have a say on legislation passed to enact Britain's exit, but the triggering of Article 50 itself was not a \"devolved matter\".\n\"The UK Parliament has retained to itself the ability to legislate for NI without the need to resort to any special procedure,\" Maguire said. \nThe arguments about May's rights to trigger Article 50 \"have been held over pending the outcome of the English litigation\", he added. \n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR SCOTLAND\nRights activist Raymond McCord told journalists at the court that the ruling was just a setback and he would continue to fight Brexit.\n\"I believe what we are doing is correct. Fifty-six percent of the people of this country (Northern Ireland) voted to remain.\"\nA group of politicians and rights groups who launched a parallel case that was merged with McCord's said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the rejection of their case, but had not yet decided whether to appeal. \nNorthern Ireland's largest Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein said it would study the judgment carefully and explore every legal and political option to ensure the remain vote was respected.\nThe ruling may have implications for Scotland, whose government argues it should have a say on Brexit because it too voted to remain in the EU.\nNicola Sturgeon, who heads the devolved Scottish government, has said it would be an act of “constitutional vandalism” to try to ignore Scotland’s voice. \nHer party has drawn up draft legislation on a second referendum on independence from the UK, which it says is an option to protect Scotland’s position within the EU.\n\n (Additional reporting by

privacy watchdogs warn WhatsApp on privacy policy, Yahoo on breach","body":"BRUSSELS European privacy watchdogs said on Friday they had sent letters to WhatsApp over its sharing of information with parent company Facebook and Yahoo over a 2014 data breach and its scanning of customer emails for U.S. intelligence purposes.\nEuropean Union data protection authorities said they had serious concerns about WhatsApp's recent change in privacy policy in which it would share users' phone numbers with Facebook, its first change in policy since Facebook bought the messaging service.\nThe authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party, \"requested WhatsApp to communicate all relevant information to the Working Party as soon as possible and urged the company to pause the sharing of users' data until the appropriate legal protections could be assured.\"\nA spokeswoman for WhatsApp said the company was working with data protection authorities to address their questions.\n\"We’ve had constructive conversations, including before our update, and we remain committed to respecting applicable law,” she said. \nThe watchdogs also wrote to Yahoo over a massive data breach that exposed the email credentials of 500 million users, as well as its scanning of customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by U.S. intelligence officials.\nThey asked the company to communicate all aspects of the data breach to the EU authorities, to notify the affected users of the \"adverse effects\" and to cooperate with all \"upcoming national data protection authorities' enquiries and/or investigations.\n\"Yahoo was invited to provide information on the legal basis and the compatibility with EU law of any such activity,\" the watchdogs said in a statement regarding the email scanning.\nThe Yahoo and WhatsApp cases will be discussed by regulators in November.\n\n (Reporting by Julia Fioretti; editing by Jason

Germany, Syrians find mosques too conservative","body":"COLOGNE, Germany Hani Salam escaped civil war in Syria and survived the journey from Egypt to Europe. But when he saw men with bushy long beards at a mosque near his current home in Cologne last November, he was worried.\nThe men's appearance reminded him of Jaish al-Islam, the Islamist rebels who took over his hometown near Damascus, said Salam, 36, who wears a mustache but no beard. One of them told Salam that \"good Muslims grow beards, not moustaches,\" he recalled – a centuries-old idea that he dismisses.\n\"Everything about this mosque made me feel uneasy,\" he said.\nSyrians in Germany say many of the country's Arab mosques are more conservative than those at home. \nOver two months, a dozen Syrians in six places of worship in three cities told Reuters they were uncomfortable with very conservative messages in Arabic-speaking mosques. People have criticized the way the newcomers dress and practice their religion, they said. Some insisted the Koran be interpreted word-for-word. \nIt is a highly contentious issue in a country where Europe's migrant influx is already having deep political and social consequences. In Germany this year Alternative for Germany, a populist party that says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, has gained ground. There have been several attacks by militant Muslims. Syrians and others say the mosque problem is adding to mistrust. \nIn Germany, other different faiths are traditionally supported by the state. But most of the country's four million Muslims originally came from Turkey and attend Turkish-speaking mosques which are partly funded by Ankara.\nLast year around 890,000 asylum-seekers, more than 70 percent of them Muslims, entered the country. Around a third came from Syria. Many of them do not want to go to Turkish mosques because they do not understand the sermons. They prefer to worship where people speak Arabic.‎\nYet in these mosques, other problems arise. They are often short of funds, or else supported by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Some back ultra-conservative or highly literal interpretations of Islam, such as Wahhabism or Salafism.\n\"Unfortunately it is true that a large majority of Arabic-speaking mosques are more conservative than Turkish mosques,\" said Professor Mouhannad Khorchide, who heads the Centre for Islamic Theology at Muenster University. That poses problems for integrating those who are less conservative.\n\"How can one absorb these people if they are interested in their religion?\" said Khorchide. \"When there is a shortage of offers the Salafists try to fill the gap.\"\n\n\"PURE ISLAMIC TEACHINGS\"\nIn Cologne, Salam said that 75 Syrians live in the same hotel as his family. Of them, only one veiled woman prays at the nearest Arabic mosque. \n\"One time when I was there, a Salafist asked a young Arab man to leave because he was wearing shorts,\" he added. \"At the Turkish mosque no one cares what you're wearing.\"\nIn a windowless ground floor room inside the Arabic mosque one Friday in August, some 200 men, including about two dozen with bushy beards and trimmed moustaches typical of ultra-Orthodox Muslims, crowded for prayers.\nAfterwards, a worshipper scolded three Lebanese men for saluting him when he entered the mosque. They had interrupted the sermon, which he said was forbidden. \"Your Friday is gone!\" he told them, lifting his hands toward his face and pressing his fingers together to emphasize that their actions had made their prayers void.\nThe imam who led the prayers said the community is not political or violent. Asked about the Syrians who felt uncomfortable at mosques like his, he said: \"It's an honor to be called a Salafist. We are only interested in giving members of our community pure Islamic teachings.\"\nEven though Salam can't understand the sermons in Turkish, he said he has started going to a Turkish mosque instead.\n \n\"BRAINWASHED\"\nA 2008 survey of Muslims and Christians in Europe by the state-funded WZB Berlin Social Science Centre found fundamentalist attitudes were less prevalent among German Muslims than elsewhere in Europe, but still quite widespread: For example, nearly half the Muslims it surveyed in Germany felt religious law to be more important than secular law.\nGermany's domestic intelligence agency has recorded more than 320 attempts by Salafist Muslims to contact refugees last year, often by offering food, clothes, free copies of the Koran and help with German to asylum seekers living in shelters. \nEarlier this month, a Syrian committed suicide in prison after he was arrested on suspicion of planning to bomb an airport. His brother and friends in Germany have said he was \"brainwashed\" by ultra-conservative imams in Berlin.\nThe intelligence agency has advised local authorities against housing asylum-seekers near Salafist or Wahhabi mosques.\n\"We know of at least 90 Islamist mosques where activities aimed at refugees are taking place. These mosques are largely Arab-dominated and influenced by Salafism,\" said Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the agency. \nAt the al-Nur mosque in Berlin, which is run by Wahhabis, Syrian Abed al-Hafian said he was alarmed by a strict interpretation of the Koran and Hadith, a collection of sayings of the prophet. He recalled a sentence from Hadith that the preacher quoted on his first Friday: 'Every novelty (in religion) is innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance leads to the hellfire.'\n\"I had never heard that sentence in Syria,\" said the 42-year-old father of three, who arrived in 2014. \"The message is clear and is directed at us Muslims: 'Don't you dare interpret your religion. Take the Koran word for word.' It's a problem.\"\nHe said he decided to take what he wants from the sermons and \"ignore the rest.\"\nEven though officials accept that not all Salafists are violent, some Syrians worry that if they go to Arabic-speaking mosques, they may be seen as radicals.\nIn Hamburg, Syrian Kurd Abu Mohammad said he has avoided going to a mosque since he arrived in Germany two years ago because his parents, who came here a decade ago, told him it could only bring trouble.\n\"The government is obviously monitoring  Salafists,\" said the 32-year-old father of six, using a nickname because he said he fears for his safety and that of relatives still living in Damascus. \n\"I have a two-year visa and the last thing I want is trouble.\"\n\nFUNDING GAP\nThe problem may be rooted in the schisms in Islam, but it is made worse by the structure of religious funding in Germany. Since the start of the 20th century Germany has had a system of collecting taxes for worship, which are then paid out to religious groups like Catholics, Protestants and Jews.\nMuslims cannot benefit from this, because the four main organizations that represent Muslims in Germany can't agree to merge into one religious body, a requirement to receive taxes.\n\"Most communities can't even afford a proper mosque ... And most can't pay a well-educated imam to serve their community,\" said Daniel Abdin, co-chairman of the Shura Council in Hamburg, an umbrella organization for the city's Muslim community. \n\"So you end up with a situation where people with little or no knowledge of modern theology are serving as imams.\"\nFive years ago, the government set up five Islamic theology centers to train imams and Islamic educators with a 20-million-euro ($22 million) grant from the Education Ministry. The strategy has been partly successful: Islamic studies are taught to Muslim pupils in many schools. \nBut few of the more than 1,800 students who have graduated from the theology centers have gone on to serve as local imams.\nNonetheless, Khorchide and other Islam experts are hopeful that the influx of Muslim asylum-seekers with an open approach to religion is an opportunity to promote a more \"moderate\" Islam in the Arabic-speaking mosques.\nIn Hamburg, Abu Mohammad says he has stopped attending mosque at all. \n\"I pray at home,\" he said. \"I'm sure Allah listens.\" \n\n\n (Additional
