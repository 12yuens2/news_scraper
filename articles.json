[{"title":"Young adult offenders rethink urged by MPs","body":"There needs to be a major change in dealing with young adult offenders, MPs have said, based on evidence that shows their brains are still developing.\nA Commons Justice Committee report says offenders aged between 18 and 25 are 10 times more likely to have a learning disability or autistic disorder.\nIt said a \"lack of action\" on these offenders had led many to re-offend.\nThe government said \"significant efforts\" had been made to prevent young people ending up in prison.\nThe committee's report argues there is a strong case for treating young adult offenders differently because their brains are still developing up to the age of 25 - meaning they are more likely to act impulsively and not weigh up the long-term effects.\nIt also found those still offending into adulthood were more likely to have learning difficulties or communication disorders, or to have suffered head injuries.\nIt said flawed interventions, set up by the Ministry of Justice and carried out by the National Offender Management Service, did not recognise young adults' needs and prevented them getting out of a cycle of crime.\nThe young adults tired of offending\nThe terror of young offender institutions\nThe number of young adults in the criminal justice system, who are mostly men, has fallen in recent years, but figures suggest 18 to 25-year-olds still account for up to 40% of the criminal caseload.\nThey also have the highest reconviction rate, with 75% returning to crime within two years of being released.\nBut the report argued that, while those in this age group offended the most, they also had the greatest potential to stop offending as they \"grow out of crime\".\nIt said age and maturity should be taken into significantly greater account within the criminal justice system and should presume that up to the age of 25 young adults were typically still maturing.\nThe committee said it welcomed the Ministry of Justice's commitment to develop a maturity assessment when dealing with young offenders but said that not screening for mental disorders and learning and communication needs was a \"missed opportunity\". \n\"This is short-sighted as such screening would enable a thorough understanding of individual needs and underpin better informed commissioning decisions for the services young adults need to address their offending,\" the report said.\nAlex Hewson, of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \"A justice system which throws young people off a cliff edge on their 18th birthday, and expects them to fend for themselves in the adult system when they are still maturing and often vulnerable, is not one that is set up to deliver for offenders, victims or local communities.\"\nA Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"Significant efforts have been made to divert young people from custody and this has resulted in a welcome reduction in the prison population - down 40% since 2010. But those in custody are in for longer and for more serious offences.\n\"We recognise the specific challenges associated with this age group and are committed to addressing these.\"

Wrongfully Accused Donald Trump\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"In recent weeks, a dozen women have come forward alleging that presidential nominee Donald J. Trump made unwanted sexual advances on them. Each of these accusers has operated, seemingly in collusion, with the sole intention of spreading outrageous falsehoods to undermine a man of great esteem and resources. Not only has this rank slander dealt a grievous blow to Mr. Trump’s reputation, but the words of these women have stained America’s legacy of fair and respectable electoral politics, and we at this newspaper can no longer stand idly by while such brazen and criminal defamation goes unpunished. \nIt is with this in mind that the editorial board of The Onion has unanimously voted, with all due humility, to offer up our offices to imprison the women who have wrongfully assailed Mr. Trump’s honor and good name.\nWe urge the public to recall that Mr. Trump is not only a globally successful businessman with a net worth in the billions of dollars, but also an aspirant to this nation’s highest office. As such, these accusations—all of them libelous and wildly defamatory—stand to profoundly erode his stature in the public eye at this critical juncture in the election cycle, which is why those responsible must be made an example of. Moving with all due haste to incarcerate these women within The Onion’s detention cells would, in our opinion, put a swift and resounding end to their present smear campaign and further act to dissuade future maligners from coming forward.\nIndeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? \nThe editorial board of this newspaper has taken the liberty of readying a private security unit to find these women wherever they may be hiding, apprehend them with all necessary force, and remove them from the society that they, through their cowardly actions, have forfeited their right to be a part of. We ask only for the assent of Mr. Trump himself.\nWe recognize that the Trump campaign may have questions about The Onion’s prison facilities and whether the conditions within them will be sufficiently isolating and punitive in light of the egregious character assaults these women have leveled against the Republican candidate. The editors of this newspaper would like to assure Mr. Trump and his staff that The Onion takes incarceration very seriously. Indeed, our detainment complex is recognized as one of the world’s premier black sites for extraordinary rendition by many foreign intelligence agencies, and we presently confine hundreds of dissidents and activists on behalf of our government partners in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, and elsewhere.\nAllow us to further assuage any doubts by elaborating on the conditions these liars and conspirators can expect while imprisoned within our headquarters:\nIf the potential for escape is a reason for concern, Mr. Trump, rest assured that The Onion has operated private correctional facilities since the Spanish-American War, when we successfully detained the most violent and wily of Spaniards, and not a single prison break has ever been successfully orchestrated from our confines. For more than 100 years, The Onion’s prisons have held the most cunning inmates, ranging from French traitor Alfred Dreyfus, to the seditious operatives exposed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, to Salman Rushdie. We would warmly welcome the addition of these women who have so contemptibly borne false witness against a political standard-bearer and American icon.\nIndeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? We most certainly believe so.\nIt is The Onion’s firm conviction that in order for civility in our republic to endure, those seeking to lead the people must be freed from fear of scurrilous aspersions that threaten the very governance of our nation. Only through vigilant prosecution and punishment of those responsible for impugning Donald J. Trump’s character can we secure this noble aim. Anything less would be a dishonor to the very tenets upon which this newspaper was founded.\nMr. Trump, we await your permission to incarcerate these deceitful women. It would be our distinct privilege.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45},{"id":1,"type":["Work","WrittenWork","PeriodicalLiterature","Newspaper"],"matchingTokens":[7,8],"entityId":"The Onion","freebaseTypes":["/computer/software_developer","/book/author","/business/business_operation","/broadcast/producer","/business/employer","/internet/website_owner","/book/newspaper_owner","/internet/social_network_user","/award/award_winner","/organization/organization","/book/periodical_publisher"],"confidenceScore":2.331,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion","matchedText":"The Onion","freebaseId":"/m/07l04","relevanceScore":0.04231,"entityEnglishId":"The Onion","startingPos":111,"endingPos":120,"wikidataId":"Q618236"},{"id":2,"type":["Species","Eukaryote","Plant","FloweringPlant"],"matchingTokens":[8],"entityId":"Onion","freebaseTypes":["/food/ingredient","/food/food","/biology/organism_classification","/medicine/drug_ingredient"],"confidenceScore":1.427,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion","matchedText":"Onion","freebaseId":"/m/0dj75","relevanceScore":0.01663,"entityEnglishId":"Onion","startingPos":115,"endingPos":120,"wikidataId":"Q23485"},{"id":3,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[22,23],"entityId":"Donald Trump","freebaseTypes":["/tv/tv_producer","/architecture/architectural_structure_owner","/celebrities/celebrity","/award/award_nominee","/symbols/name_source","/organization/organization_founder","/book/author","/book/book_subject","/film/person_or_entity_appearing_in_film","/tv/tv_program_guest","/tv/tv_personality","/film/actor","/tv/tv_program_creator","/people/measured_person","/business/board_member","/people/person","/award/award_winner","/tv/tv_actor"],"confidenceScore":4.251,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump","matchedText":"Donald Trump","freebaseId":"/m/0cqt90","relevanceScore":0.1304,"entityEnglishId":"Donald Trump","startingPos":200,"endingPos":212,"wikidataId":"Q22686"}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[12,13],"entityId":"Presidential nominee","confidenceScore":1.766,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee","matchedText":"presidential nominee","freebaseId":"/m/066q5c","relevanceScore":0.07983,"entityEnglishId":"Presidential nominee","startingPos":63,"endingPos":83,"wikidataId":"Q2380299"},{"id":1,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[14,15,16],"entityId":"Donald Trump","freebaseTypes":["/tv/tv_producer","/architecture/architectural_structure_owner","/celebrities/celebrity","/award/award_nominee","/symbols/name_source","/organization/organization_founder","/book/author","/book/book_subject","/film/person_or_entity_appearing_in_film","/tv/tv_program_guest","/tv/tv_personality","/film/actor","/tv/tv_program_creator","/people/measured_person","/business/board_member","/people/person","/award/award_winner","/tv/tv_actor"],"confidenceScore":3.403,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump","matchedText":"Donald J.

Parents were recorded with their child, who might have been sitting, playing alone.\nBut mum and dad were then shown a highlights package of the easily-missed moments when the autistic child subtly moved to play with their parents.\nCommunication specialists then worked with the parents to give them the skills to get the most out of these brief moments. \nIn small steps, it eventually moved on to getting the child to speak more. \nLouisa told the BBC: \"You notice things you wouldn't notice in real time.\n\"Things like waiting, giving Frank plenty of time to communicate and commenting rather than questioning him, which puts on pressure to respond.\n\"You feel like you're being really skilled-up by these people who trust your judgement about what makes your child tick,\" she added.\nThe trial with 152 families started shortly after the children were diagnosed around the age of three. \nNormally their symptoms would get worse with age. \nIn the half of the families given the usual therapies, 50% were severely autistic at the beginning and that percentage predictably increased to 63% after six years.\nBut the opposite happened in the families given the intensive training. \nAmong these, 55% of the children were severely autistic at the beginning and only 46% after six years. \nThe report's lead author, Prof Jonathan Green from the University of Manchester, said the results were \"extraordinary\".\nHe added: \"This is not a 'cure', in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms\".\nBut he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the research suggested working with parents could lead to long-term improvements.\nHe said: \"It suggests that what the parents have been able to embed into the family has sustained even after the end of the therapy which is really encouraging.\"\nAdumea, whose son Kofi, 12, took part in the research, told the BBC: \"What's so powerful about this therapy is the fact that it extends beyond the hour you spend within the therapist's office, because it carries on into the home.\n\"And as Professor Green said, it embeds into family life and the way in which you communicate with your children and from what you learn from that, you can then tell schools: 'This is working, try this'.\" \nOne in 100 people develops some degree of autism, but there is no drug treatment and families often desperately turn to quack therapies. \nDr James Cusack, the director of science at the charity Autistica, said: \"Parents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis, but when they finally get it, the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them. \n\"Too often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. \n\"These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science,\" he added. \nDr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \"[This] is a hugely cheering message for families.\"\nFollow James on

Wrongfully Accused Donald Trump\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"In recent weeks, a dozen women have come forward alleging that presidential nominee Donald J. Trump made unwanted sexual advances on them. Each of these accusers has operated, seemingly in collusion, with the sole intention of spreading outrageous falsehoods to undermine a man of great esteem and resources. Not only has this rank slander dealt a grievous blow to Mr. Trump’s reputation, but the words of these women have stained America’s legacy of fair and respectable electoral politics, and we at this newspaper can no longer stand idly by while such brazen and criminal defamation goes unpunished. \nIt is with this in mind that the editorial board of The Onion has unanimously voted, with all due humility, to offer up our offices to imprison the women who have wrongfully assailed Mr. Trump’s honor and good name.\nWe urge the public to recall that Mr. Trump is not only a globally successful businessman with a net worth in the billions of dollars, but also an aspirant to this nation’s highest office. As such, these accusations—all of them libelous and wildly defamatory—stand to profoundly erode his stature in the public eye at this critical juncture in the election cycle, which is why those responsible must be made an example of. Moving with all due haste to incarcerate these women within The Onion’s detention cells would, in our opinion, put a swift and resounding end to their present smear campaign and further act to dissuade future maligners from coming forward.\nIndeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? \nThe editorial board of this newspaper has taken the liberty of readying a private security unit to find these women wherever they may be hiding, apprehend them with all necessary force, and remove them from the society that they, through their cowardly actions, have forfeited their right to be a part of. We ask only for the assent of Mr. Trump himself.\nWe recognize that the Trump campaign may have questions about The Onion’s prison facilities and whether the conditions within them will be sufficiently isolating and punitive in light of the egregious character assaults these women have leveled against the Republican candidate. The editors of this newspaper would like to assure Mr. Trump and his staff that The Onion takes incarceration very seriously. Indeed, our detainment complex is recognized as one of the world’s premier black sites for extraordinary rendition by many foreign intelligence agencies, and we presently confine hundreds of dissidents and activists on behalf of our government partners in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, and elsewhere.\nAllow us to further assuage any doubts by elaborating on the conditions these liars and conspirators can expect while imprisoned within our headquarters:\nIf the potential for escape is a reason for concern, Mr. Trump, rest assured that The Onion has operated private correctional facilities since the Spanish-American War, when we successfully detained the most violent and wily of Spaniards, and not a single prison break has ever been successfully orchestrated from our confines. For more than 100 years, The Onion’s prisons have held the most cunning inmates, ranging from French traitor Alfred Dreyfus, to the seditious operatives exposed by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, to Salman Rushdie. We would warmly welcome the addition of these women who have so contemptibly borne false witness against a political standard-bearer and American icon.\nIndeed, even if Mr. Trump did commit an act or two of those which he has been accused, shouldn’t his immense prestige give him license to make a mistake here or there without it tarnishing his character and jeopardizing his chances at elected office? We most certainly believe so.\nIt is The Onion’s firm conviction that in order for civility in our republic to endure, those seeking to lead the people must be freed from fear of scurrilous aspersions that threaten the very governance of our nation. Only through vigilant prosecution and punishment of those responsible for impugning Donald J. Trump’s character can we secure this noble aim. Anything less would be a dishonor to the very tenets upon which this newspaper was founded.\nMr. Trump, we await your permission to incarcerate these deceitful women. It would be our distinct privilege.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45},{"id":1,"type":["Work","WrittenWork","PeriodicalLiterature","Newspaper"],"matchingTokens":[7,8],"entityId":"The Onion","freebaseTypes":["/computer/software_developer","/book/author","/business/business_operation","/broadcast/producer","/business/employer","/internet/website_owner","/book/newspaper_owner","/internet/social_network_user","/award/award_winner","/organization/organization","/book/periodical_publisher"],"confidenceScore":2.331,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Onion","matchedText":"The Onion","freebaseId":"/m/07l04","relevanceScore":0.04231,"entityEnglishId":"The Onion","startingPos":111,"endingPos":120,"wikidataId":"Q618236"},{"id":2,"type":["Species","Eukaryote","Plant","FloweringPlant"],"matchingTokens":[8],"entityId":"Onion","freebaseTypes":["/food/ingredient","/food/food","/biology/organism_classification","/medicine/drug_ingredient"],"confidenceScore":1.427,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion","matchedText":"Onion","freebaseId":"/m/0dj75","relevanceScore":0.01663,"entityEnglishId":"Onion","startingPos":115,"endingPos":120,"wikidataId":"Q23485"},{"id":3,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[22,23],"entityId":"Donald Trump","freebaseTypes":["/tv/tv_producer","/architecture/architectural_structure_owner","/celebrities/celebrity","/award/award_nominee","/symbols/name_source","/organization/organization_founder","/book/author","/book/book_subject","/film/person_or_entity_appearing_in_film","/tv/tv_program_guest","/tv/tv_personality","/film/actor","/tv/tv_program_creator","/people/measured_person","/business/board_member","/people/person","/award/award_winner","/tv/tv_actor"],"confidenceScore":4.251,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump","matchedText":"Donald Trump","freebaseId":"/m/0cqt90","relevanceScore":0.1304,"entityEnglishId":"Donald Trump","startingPos":200,"endingPos":212,"wikidataId":"Q22686"}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[12,13],"entityId":"Presidential nominee","confidenceScore":1.766,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee","matchedText":"presidential nominee","freebaseId":"/m/066q5c","relevanceScore":0.07983,"entityEnglishId":"Presidential nominee","startingPos":63,"endingPos":83,"wikidataId":"Q2380299"},{"id":1,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[14,15,16],"entityId":"Donald Trump","freebaseTypes":["/tv/tv_producer","/architecture/architectural_structure_owner","/celebrities/celebrity","/award/award_nominee","/symbols/name_source","/organization/organization_founder","/book/author","/book/book_subject","/film/person_or_entity_appearing_in_film","/tv/tv_program_guest","/tv/tv_personality","/film/actor","/tv/tv_program_creator","/people/measured_person","/business/board_member","/people/person","/award/award_winner","/tv/tv_actor"],"confidenceScore":3.403,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump","matchedText":"Donald J.

I might not be able to drink as much as I normally could after a full week’s rest, but I’ll go hard and throw back as many beers as I can. There’s no way I would miss an opportunity to get totally hammered when my team is in the World Series.” Sanford added that he is hoping to avoid a repeat of Game 4 of the 2015 NLCS, when he was taken out of the bar by his friends after throwing up twice on just eight shots in the first four innings.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Company"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Cubs","freebaseTypes":["/organization/organization"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Cubs","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":8,"endingPos":12},{"id":1,"type":["Duration"],"matchingTokens":[10,11],"entityId":"2","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2

Brampton: Journalist killed herself after 'missed opportunities'","body":"Sally Brampton, founding editor of Elle magazine in the UK, killed herself after health professionals \"missed opportunities\" to offer her help, an inquest has heard.\nMs Brampton, 60, who wrote a Daily Mail advice column, drowned after walking into the sea near her home on 10 May.\nHastings Coroners' Court heard she was \"in crisis\" in March 2016 and had sought help from a psychiatrist and GP.\nBut \"that help did not come\", assistant coroner James Healy-Pratt added.\nMs Brampton, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, was pulled ashore at Galley Hill, Bexhill, on 10 May.\nThe agony aunt, who had spoken out publicly about her long-running battle with depression, had been referred to local mental health services two months earlier, the inquest heard.\nHowever, she was not offered any help and she again contacted a GP in April.\nIt was agreed she was \"out of crisis\" at this stage. However, the coroner heard her full clinical details - including a letter from her private psychiatrist - had not been provided to the relevant services.\nThe letter, dated 19 March, stated Ms Brampton was \"in crisis\" and having \"strong suicidal thoughts\".\nIt said Ms Brampton was having feelings of \"hopelessness and helplessness\", adding that she had spent most of the last week in bed and had hardly left the house.\nMs Brampton had \"disengaged\" from local services and had \"painted a very jaundiced view of them\", the letter added.\nMr Healy-Pratt said there was \"a missed opportunity\" to help Ms Brampton in March and more information should have been provided before the second referral.\n\"However, we don't know that those missed opportunities would have changed Sally's outcome and that is an important factor,\" he added.\nMr Healy-Pratt said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Brampton wanted to walk into the sea and he recorded a verdict of suicide.\nChristine Henham, a general manager at Hastings and Rother mental health services, said lessons had been learned and changes have been made since Ms Brampton's death.\nShe said the team no longer sends or receive faxes, after the GP said he had faxed the psychiatrist's letter to them.\nMs Brampton had studied fashion at Central Saint Martin's College of Art & Design before starting at Vogue. \nShe became fashion editor at The Observer and was then headhunted to launch women's lifestyle magazine Elle in the UK at the age of 30 in the 1980s.\nShe later had a weekly agony aunt column in the Sunday Times Style magazine from 2006 until 2014.\nIn 2008 she gave a personal account of her efforts to overcome depression in her book \"Shoot the Damn Dog\".  \nThe coroner described Ms Brampton as a \"bright star\" and began his conclusion with the writer's words: \"We don't kill ourselves. We are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[0,1],"entityId":"Sally

expansion plans?","body":"The government may have decided to go ahead with Heathrow's third runway, but that doesn't mean the debate is over. \nProtest groups and local councils are already vowing to oppose it all the way, and some say a third runway is unlikely to be completed before 2030 because of the planning and environmental issues.\nBut as air travel is expected to continue growing significantly in the first half of the 21st Century, how are the UK's other major airports planning to expand?\nGatwick is the UK's second-busiest airport, handling 40 million passengers a year on one runway, according to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) figures. And even before the government's Heathrow announcement, the airport's chief executive, Stewart Wingate, was arguing for a second runway at Gatwick.\nMr Wingate says the barriers and obstacles - especially noise and air quality - to building at Heathrow mean a new runway will prove impossible. \n\"There is one reason why Heathrow has repeatedly tried and failed to expand - its location,\" he says. \nIn its 2015 report, the Airports Commission rejected Gatwick, saying that a new runway was \"unlikely to provide as much of the type of capacity which is most urgently required - long-haul destinations in new markets\".\nResponding to the go-ahead for Heathrow, Mr Wingate said: \"We are disappointed as we do not believe this is the right answer for Britain.\" \nGatwick bosses argue that their second runway could be built for half the estimated cost of a new Heathrow runway - and in operation sooner. They have already lined up the US construction firm Bechtel to do the work.\nBechtel has considerable experience working in the UK: it was involved with the construction of the Channel Tunnel; the HS1 rail link; and is currently working on completing London's Crossrail project.\n75 million\nHeathrow\n40 million\nGatwick\n23 million Manchester \n22 million Stansted \n12 million Luton \n11 million Edinburgh \nA 30-year agreement not to build a new runway at Gatwick expires in 2019. Mr Wingate and his team say a new terminal and second runway could be complete by 2025 and would be \"fully privately funded\".\nBut Gatwick also faces its own opposition from local groups and politicians - while critics wonder whether Gatwick would actually be able to finance the project privately.\nThere's a question, too, over how much support the project has received from major airlines, and whether south-east England really needs two new runways.\nManchester airport is already the country's third busiest. Unlike Gatwick it already has two runways, giving it significant capacity for growth.\nLast year, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), which owns Stansted, Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports, announced a 10-year £1bn expansion programme to improve and expand the existing terminals, including a new security hall and pre-flight customs clearance for travellers to the US.  \nThe airport already serves more than 70 airlines and has more than 200 short and long-haul destinations. It is the only UK airport outside London with direct routes to destinations such as Miami, Hong Kong, Jeddah, Singapore, Atlanta, Washington and Boston. \n\"Aviation growth is just as important outside of London and the South East, not least at Manchester, given its critical role in the region,\" says MAG chief executive Charlie Cornish.\n\"Manchester Airport will connect the Northern Powerhouse to global markets - boosting the region's economy by around £10bn - far more than any other airport.\" \nHigh speed rail, in the form of HS2 and an east-west link dubbed HS3, is also key for both Manchester airport and the wider region.\nThe airport is important \"not just for Manchester but for the whole of the North of England,\" says Transport Minister Andrew Jones, confirming that the government is developing plans for HS3 alongside HS2, saying: \"We are looking at integration of the two.\"\nMAG had warned the government that if it allowed both Heathrow and Gatwick expansion to go ahead, it could face a legal challenge.  \nThe company said the Airports Commission only fully examined the case for one new runway to be built before 2030 (though the Commission did conclude two would be needed to fulfil demand by 2050).\nOther airports have not been given the chance to make their own pitches for airport expansion after 2030, something that should happen before a second new runway gets approval, said the firm.\nStansted airport is the UK's fourth-busiest in terms of passenger numbers, but it didn't make it to the Airports Commission shortlist. However, the Commission did say there was likely to be a case for considering the potential for a new runway by 2050.\nStansted's owners, MAG, argue that the airport is in a \"sweet spot\" between the London and the UK's fastest-growing region, East Anglia, and is thus best placed to meet London's future needs.\nHenri Pageot, a former facilities planning director at BAA (which previously owned Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) says a new runway at Stansted should be built sooner rather than later - instead of focusing on Heathrow.  \nMr Pageot, a civil engineer, was responsible for the planning and specification of Heathrow's Terminal 4, Terminal 5, Gatwick's North terminal and the current development of Stansted.  \n\"The UK should expand Stansted because it would be faster to achieve, strategically more logical, and would be a more long-term solution to the problem of UK airport capacity and associated access, than either Heathrow or Gatwick,\" he says.\nHis proposal is to build a new short-haul runway and terminal that would free up the existing long-haul 3,000m (9,840ft) runway for international traffic (currently this is running at 57% capacity).\nMr Pageot's view is that given the growth in the Asia-Pacific market, long-haul business travellers from China are likely to want good access to manufacturing in the Midlands, Cambridge and its growing IT hub, as well as to the Felixstowe container port and the City of London.\nFor travellers using public transport at Luton airport, the main bugbear has been that it does not have an integrated railway station. At the moment, passengers who don't come by car have to get a shuttle bus to nearby Luton Parkway station. \nHowever, this April, the airport announced plans for a £200m light railway system linking the two. When it is complete, passengers will be able to travel between London St Pancras and the terminal in under 30 minutes.\nBut airport bosses - along with the CBI, Federation of Small Businesses and EasyJet - say that more fast trains from central London are crucial to the airport's future growth.\nLuton is currently the UK's fastest-growing airport in terms of passenger numbers (up 17% last year, according to the CAA) and  is now undertaking a £110m redevelopment project that should increase its capacity by 50% to 18 million passengers a year by 2020.\n\"Rail service improvements are needed to ensure that this capacity can be efficiently and sustainably used,\" says airport chief executive Nick Barton.\n\"Luton is at the intersection of two strategically important economic corridors: from north to south, and from east to west, between the high employment and high-skill Cambridge and Oxford corridor,\" he says.\n\"There is a clear economic and social benefit to improving connectivity in the region.\"\nWith two runways, Edinburgh is Scotland's busiest airport and comes in at number six in the UK rankings. \nThe airport contributes nearly £1bn to the Scottish economy ever year and supports more than 23,000 jobs across the country, according to a recent study by Biggar Economics.\nReacting to the Heathrow announcement, Edinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said \"Heathrow's expansion risks a monopolised market which is bad for passengers\".\nScotland's airports are less dependent on London than they have ever been, said Mr Dewar, adding that \"our passengers tell us that they want to fly directly\".\nMuch of the airport's growth over the past three years has come from international travellers, and last month the number of international passengers was up by 21.5% compared with September 2015.\nScotland's airports should \"no longer need to think of ourselves as feeder airports for London,\" he said.\nThe airport is currently in the middle of a five-year £150m investment programme. Since 2014 it has had a tram link to Edinburgh city. \nIn December 2016, the £41m Edinburgh Gateway station is scheduled to open, allowing rail passengers to reach the city's airport more easily. \nThe airport is also urging the Scottish government to give greater clarity on its long-promised cut in Air Passenger Duty (APD).\nA 50% cut in APD would mean an additional 18 million passengers using Scotland's airports by 2021 - giving a significant boost to the economy, it argues.\nIt is possible that Birmingham, which is currently the UK's seventh-busiest airport in passenger numbers, could be slated for future expansion thanks to high speed rail developments that will cut journey times into central London. \nLast month the airport announced it was spending £100m on improvements to its facilities and infrastructure - on top of the £300m it has invested in recent years - and two years ago it extended its runway to 3,000m. \nWhile the Airports Commission rejected the need for immediate expansion at Birmingham, saying the airport would not be operating at capacity until the mid-2040s, it left the door open for a rethink once the impact of HS2 on travel patterns had become clearer.\nIndeed, Howard Davies, who chaired the Commission, wrote this week in the Daily Telegraph: \"With HS2 in place, Birmingham might indeed be a more interesting option.\"\nOnce the rail link is completed, says airport chief executive Paul Kehoe, Birmingham will be \"in a unique position\" and will become \"the UK's only HS2-connected airport, growing the catchment into London with high-speed

doing in the region, kidnapped journalist Tim Cascella reportedly found himself Thursday having to explain to several ISIS militants what BuzzFeed News is. “So, it’s part of a broader digital media network, and it started out as a spinoff from our entertainment content because that made more sense from an advertising perspective, but now it’s a separate news vertical of its own—it reports on stuff like any other news site, I swear,” said a frightened Cascella, who only seemed to perplex and anger his interrogators further when, after being asked to state his background, he mentioned that he got his start writing listicles for the website before eventually moving up to report on actual real-world events. “No, I don’t have a physical copy; it’s only online. We’re sort of like Huffington Post, if you’re familiar with that, but for a younger audience. Maybe you’ve done one of our quizzes? They’re very popular. If you just go to BuzzFeed.com—and try not to look at the homepage—then just click on ‘News,’ which is the first tab, it will bring you to actual news stories. I promise.” At press time, Cascella’s captors had decided to release him after determining that he was not a journalist.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Country"],"matchingTokens":[6],"entityId":"Islamic State of Iraq and the

Booker Prize: Paul Beatty becomes first US winner for The Sellout","body":"Paul Beatty has become the first US author to win the Man Booker Prize with his racial satire The Sellout. \nHis novel tells the story of a young black man who tries to reinstate slavery and racial segregation in a suburb of Los Angeles.\nAmanda Foreman, chair of the judges, said the book managed \"to eviscerate every social taboo\". \nBeatty's win was announced at a ceremony at London's Guildhall on Tuesday. \nPicking up the £50,000 prize from the Duchess of Cornwall, Beatty, 54, was clearly overwhelmed with emotion and struggled for words as he began his acceptance speech. \n\"I hate writing,\" he admitted later in the speech.  \n\"This is a hard book,\" he went on. \"It was a hard for me to write, I know it's hard to read. Everyone's coming at it from different angles.\"\nThis is the third year that the £50,000 prize has been open to writers of any nationality.  The shortlist included two British, two US, one Canadian and one British-Canadian writer.\nThe Sellout beat five other novels, including Madeleine Thien's Do Not Say We Have Nothing, the bookies' favourite, and Graeme Macrae Burnet's Scottish crime thriller His Bloody Project.\nForeman said the judges took about four hours to reach their unanimous decision. \nShe said The Sellout was \"a novel for our times\" that contained \"an absolutely savage wit\" reminiscent of Jonathan Swift or Mark Twain.\n\"This is a book that nails the reader to the cross with cheerful abandon,\" she elaborated. \"But while you are being nailed you are being tickled.\"\nBeatty was \"someone writing at the top of their game\", she added. \n\"This is a first-class piece of serious literature wrapped up in a shawl of humour.\" \nThe novel is narrated by Bonbon - a resident of the fictional \"agrarian ghetto\" of Dickens on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles, which has been removed from the map to save California from embarrassment. \nBonbon is on trial in the Supreme Court for attempting to reinstitute slavery and segregation in the local high school as a means of bringing about civic order.\nFrances Gertler, web editor at Foyles bookshops, described The Sellout as \"a smart satire with a memorable narrator\".\n\"Brave and funny - it takes a bit of getting into but once there, you don't want to leave,\" she said.  \nWaterstones fiction buyer, Chris White, said: \"The Booker judges have awarded the most significant of literary prizes to what feels like the most significant novel to have emerged in these strange and difficult times.\" \nBorn in Los Angeles in 1962, Beatty's three previous novels are Slumberland, Tuff and The White Boy Shuffle. He now lives in New York. \nThe shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. The winner receives a further £50,000.\nThis is the second consecutive Man Booker Prize success for independent publisher Oneworld, following Marlon James's win with A Brief History of Seven Killings in 2015. \nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram, or if you have a story suggestion email .

Street slips on earnings; Apple falls late after results","body":"NEW YORK U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations.\nApple (AAPL.O), the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures ESc1 to session lows.\nDuring the regular session, Whirlpool (WHR.N), down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' (SHW.N) outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61.\nBoth were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling.\n\"Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle,\" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.\nShe said those results could be weighing on Home Depot (HD.N), which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos (LOW.N) fell 3.5 percent to $68.47.\nConsumer products company Procter & Gamble (PG.N) rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour (UA.N) fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years.\n“We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a \"mixed bag.\"\nOverall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOf the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40.\nFutures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories.\n3M (MMM.N) fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time.\nCaterpillar (CAT.N) lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors (GM.N) fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows.  \nAbout 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.\n\n (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Nick Zieminski and James

government initiative to improve the condition of global soils.\nMinisters from both governments are meeting the prince to discuss how to improve soil health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farming.\nTypically the focus of cutting greenhouse gases has fallen on transport and industry, but France says agriculture must play its part.\nMinisters will debate how to store more carbon in soils.\nThey will also discuss how to restore degraded soils, improve fertility and increase food security.\nThe French farm ministry says farming and forestry can contribute between 20% and 60% of potential cuts in greenhouse gases up to to 2030.\nIt says changes to farming methods can save 12-15 million tonnes of CO2 through livestock farming alone. It lists the need for:\nPrevious attempts to nudge Britain's farmers into cutting emissions have largely failed. The Committee on Climate Change noted that emissions from agriculture have been broadly level since 2008 while industry and power generation emissions have dropped sharply.\nThe French farm ministry quotes statistics from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projecting that farming and forestry can contribute between 20% and 60% of potential cuts in greenhouse gases up to 2030.\nPeter Melchett from the Soil Association told BBC News: \"The French initiative is extraordinarily important. It has put greenhouse gas emissions from farming on the global climate change agenda for the first time since Kyoto (the first climate agreement in 1997).\n\"It highlights the desperate need to stop emissions of greenhouse gases from soils - especially lowland drained peat - and the huge potential for sequestering carbon in agricultural soils.\"\nThe Commons Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) recommended in May that in order to implement an initiative from last year's Paris climate summit to increase soil carbon levels by 0.4% per year, the government should set out specific, measurable and time-limited actions.\nThe government responded agreed the importance of the initiative and said it was investigating what action to take.\nLord Krebs from the Committee on Climate Change said: \"The health of the UK's soils is of critical importance for the productive capacity of our agricultural land.\n\"A combination of population and economic growth are expected to increase global demand for food in the future. At the same time, climate change could reduce the capacity of the land globally to keep pace with growing demand.\n\"It is, therefore, essential that we are doing all we can to protect the long-term productive capacity of our agricultural soils.\"\nThe Anglo-French meeting has been organised by The Prince of Wales' International Sustainability Unit in collaboration with both governments.\nFollow

Jungle clearance to resume after tent-burning, gas explosions overnight","body":"CALAIS, France The \"Jungle\" migrant camp near Calais woke up to a third day of a government operation to empty and clear it on Wednesday following a night of ritual tent and shelter-burning and some gas-bottle explosions.\nA Calais prefecture official told France Info radio on Wednesday morning that one person had been slightly injured in his inner ear by one of the explosions and had been taken to hospital.\n\"The operation will continue today to remove the empty shelters and to avoid them being set fire to again,\" a prefecture spokesman told Reuters. \nLate on Tuesday, regional prefect Fabienne Buccio said it was difficult to prevent the fires.\n\"Some migrants follow traditions - we asked them not to do it - but they set ablaze their tents and their shelters when they leave,\" she said.\n\"We told them not to do it, but some...do it anyway. We are on standby, the fire brigade is in the vicinity to guarantee security and to prevent the fire from spreading. It's part of a tradition. Even if we would like them to refrain from doing it, they do it.\"\nMigrants fleeing poverty and war outside Europe have over the past few years congregated at Calais, the main port entry to Britain from France, in the hope of finding new lives across the short stretch of sea.\nThey have continued to come despite the high fences built over past months to keep them from crossing.\nLocal opposition to the presence of over 6,000 people at the squalid and insanitary camp and criticism from right-wing politicians has stung the government into action. More than 4,000 have been bussed out to reception centers across France since Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Matthias Blamont and Pierre Savary; Writing by Andrew Callus; Editing by Dominique

Motor Corp (7203.T) on Wednesday said it was recalling about 5.8 million cars at home and abroad over potentially faulty air bag inflators made by Takata Corp. (7312.T), including those used as replacement parts following a 2010 recall.\nAutomakers worldwide are ramping up the industry's biggest-ever recall after parts supplier Takata, under pressure from U.S. authorities, agreed earlier this year to declare more of its air bags as defective in the United States and other countries. \nThe air bag inflators in question use a chemical compound which can explode with excessive force after prolonged exposure to hot conditions, and have been linked to at least 16 deaths globally, mainly in the United States.\nToyota's latest recall includes the Corolla, one of the world's best-selling models, and the Vitz or Yaris subcompact hatchback model. It covers driver-side and passenger-side airbags installed in cars produced between May 2000 and November 2001, and April 2006 and December 2014, the company said in an email.\nIt affects about 1.16 million vehicles sold in Japan, about 820,000 cars sold in China and around 1.47 million cars in the European market.\nThe recall extends to Central and South America, Africa, the Near and Middle East and Singapore, and also includes the Hilux pick-up truck and the Etios line of sedans and hatchbacks.\nThe move shows the complicated nature of the inflator recall, which began around 2008 and continues to expand.\nThe latest recall includes about 20,000 cars which were fitted with replacement Takata inflators following an initial 2010 recall, as the replacement parts are also seen to be at risk of exploding as they do not contain a drying agent.\nTransport authorities around the world now consider inflators without a drying agent to be unsafe, and have ordered all of them to be withdrawn.\nSince global transportation authorities expanded their recall from May, about 100 million Takata air bag inflators have been classified as defective worldwide.\nTakata is seeking a financial investor to help pay for huge liabilities from the recall, and has been meeting with potential sponsors and automaker clients to discuss its survival options.\n\n\n (Reporting by Naomi

October","body":"NEW YORK U.S. home prices rose 5.1 percent in the year to August as home buyers competed for fewer properties, helped by low mortgage interest rates, some wage growth and low unemployment. \nThe S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller report published on Tuesday said its 20-city index was up 5.1 percent, after a rise of 5.0 percent in the year to July. The national index has now almost recovered to the record high set in July 2006 before the financial crisis of 2008.\n\"All 20 cities saw prices higher than a year earlier with 10 enjoying larger annual gains than last month,\" David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said. \nThe acceleration in home price inflation comes after other signs the housing recovery is gaining strength. \nSales of existing U.S. homes increased 3.2 percent in September from August, but the number of homes for sale has fallen nearly 7.0 percent from a year ago, the National Association of Realtors said last week. Just 2.04 million existing homes were for sale in September.\nBuilding of new single-family houses rose 8.1 percent in September, in data published earlier by the Commerce Department, although the annual rate of 783,000 starts remains well below the historical average of more than one million annual rate of new home building.\n\"Demand is high and enthusiasm for homeownership remains strong, especially among all-important young, minority and would-be first-time buyers,\" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at real estate data provider Zillow, said.\nCase-Shiller's national index, after seasonal adjustment,  rose 0.6 percent month-over-month in August, while the 10-city and 20-city indexes rose 0.2 percent. \nPortland, Seattle and Denver reported the strongest year-over-year increases for the seventh month in a row, with gains of 11.7 percent, 11.4 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively, as buyers were forced out of the expensive Silicon Valley area in California.\nAfter the financial crisis of 2008, home prices plunged 35 percent from their peak in July 2006 until they bottomed out in March 2012. They have since risen to just 7.2 percent below the peak.\n\nCONSUMER CONFIDENCE SLIPS\nConsumers' perceptions of both current conditions and the six-month outlook dimmed in October, with the U.S. Conference Board's confidence index slipping to 98.6 in October, down from 103.5 in September.\nEconomists expected the index to hit 101.5 in October, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.\nThe survey, a closely followed barometer of consumer attitudes, measures confidence toward business conditions, short-term outlook, personal finances and jobs.\n\"Consumer confidence retreated in October, after back-to-back monthly gains,\" said Lynn Franc, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. \n\"Consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat. However, consumers' expectations regarding their income prospects in the coming months were relatively unchanged.\"\nMonthly U.S. job growth slowed to an average 161,000 in August and September after gains in the previous two months and is averaging 178,000 this year, down from 229,000 in 2015. \nHowever, unemployment remained low at 5.0 percent in September.\nThe Conference Board report also said the present situation index, which measures overall consumer sentiments toward the present economic situation, decreased to 120.6 from 127.9 in the prior month. The Expectations Index, which measures sentiments for the next 6-months, declined to 83.9 from 87.2 in September.\n\n(This version of the story , corrects organization name to \"Zillow\" in the 7th

streets of the Scripps Ranch neighborhood have been pure gold for solar installers. \nThanks to its high power prices, hot summers and large homes to cool, a greater share of Scripps Ranch residents have embraced solar power than anywhere else in California, itself the nation's solar energy leader.\nThe rooftops of some 2,000 homes - 26 percent - are fitted with panels in Scripps Ranch, according to an analysis of state and utility solar installation numbers and U.S. Census Bureau housing data by the non-profit Center for Sustainable Energy and the environmental news web site EcoWatch.\nThe growth has been rapid. In July of 2014, San Diego installer Sullivan Solar put up its first solar system on Scripps Ranch’s Pinecastle Street, celebrating with a block party. The pizza and wine paid off: Sullivan installed systems on 11 of 48 homes on the street.\n“If you can afford the upfront, it’s a no brainer,” said Caroline Coats, a nearby resident who hired Sullivan to install a solar system four years ago.\nAs much as Scripps Ranch symbolizes rooftop solar's success, it also illustrates the challenges facing the industry today. After rising 64 percent in the first half of the year in Scripps Ranch, installations tumbled 50 percent in July and August combined, according to utility data. Across California, growth also has slowed this year, and, in the third quarter, installations dropped year over year.\nIndustry watchers say many factors are at play, including shrinking incentives, wariness of future government actions and consumer fatigue with marketing tactics. Also, many of the most likely buyers - affluent, environmentally inclined homeowners in sunny places – already have rooftop systems, making winning new customers harder and costlier.\n\nLESS INCENTIVE\nCalifornia for years has required utilities to purchase  excess rooftop solar power, paying homeowners in credits that lower their utility bills. But this so-called “net-metering” mandate capped the number of people who qualified for the most attractive incentive. In June, the utility serving Scripps Ranch, Sempra Energy (SRE.N) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, was the first to reach its limit, and the state’s other large utilities are expected to reach theirs soon.\nScripps Ranch homeowners who put up panels now still will be able to sell power they don't use to the utility at the same  retail rates as those who got in before the cap. But they will have to pay $100 to $200 more per year in fees and charges to SDG&E. They also eventually will be shifted to new, time-of-use power rates, which could result in lower credits.\nInstallers say such changes will be meager compared to the thousands of dollars in savings over the life of a system. But customers seem skeptical. At the peak, installers were putting up 55 systems a month, on average, in Scripps Ranch. In July and August - typically good months - installations dropped to 15 and 36, respectively.\nResidential solar connections were down 25 percent in the third quarter compared to a year earlier in the utility's entire San Diego territory.\n\"The phones just aren't ringing as much,\" said Ian Lochore, director of residential sales at Baker Electric in nearby Escondido.\nA less dramatic slowdown is playing out across California, which produces about 40 percent of the nation’s residential solar.\nThe sector saw slower growth in the first half of the year, and declines in the third quarter. Installations in Pacific Gas & Electric’s service territory in Northern and Central California fell 7 percent year-over-year, while in Southern California Edison’s territory they fell 4 percent.\nNational installers like SolarCity Corp (SCTY.O) and Sunrun Inc (RUN.O), whose investors had gotten used to sky-high growth rates, slashed forecasts this year, while their stocks have been pummeled. SolarCity has agreed to be bought by electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O), but investors have concerns about the wisdom of merging two companies that require substantial cash to fund growth. \n    \nFEWER POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS\n    Now that many of the homeowners best-positioned to benefit from rooftop installations have them, today’s pool of potential customers has less incentive to go solar.\n    “A lot of the early adopters have gone solar already, so the market is kind of shifting toward people who might need more information or explanation before they make the shift,” PG&E spokeswoman Ari Vanrenen said.\nIn Scripps Ranch, for instance, many homeowners without solar say their power bills are too low, or their rooftops too shady.\nKen Ingrao, a Scripps Ranch resident who said he did \"tons of research\" about solar, decided his $220-a-month power bill was too low to justify an investment of up to $28,000.\n\"It's a good option for people who are spending … $800 a month putting the air on 24-7,\" Ingrao said. \"But we don't do that.\"\nWorking harder to win customers has raised costs. Both SolarCity and Sunrun reported large increases in sales and marketing costs in the first half of the year compared with 2015. Customer acquisition costs could rise further this year, GTM Research said.\nMore aggressive marketing carries risks, however.\nSome solar vendors \"come across as used car sales people,\" said Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of EnergySage, an online comparison-shopping marketplace for solar.\n\"A lot of consumers tell us that their first interaction with solar was negative,” he said.\nNearly 300 people filed solar-related complaints with the state last year, an increase of 25 percent, according to the California Contractors State Licensing Board, which pledged to step up enforcement. \n\nBIGGEST COMPANIES HARDEST HIT\n    The slowdown is having the greatest impact on the industry’s biggest installers.\nA drop in installations in regions served by SCE and PG&E between the first and second quarters of this year mostly involved U.S. installer SolarCity, a GTM Research analysis of installation data showed. Sunrun installations were flat, while local and regional installers, on average, showed growth.\nSolarCity spokesman Jonathan Bass blamed lackluster performance in the second quarter on the fact that it was leasing installations to customers rather than offering a loan to purchase. Demand for a loan option introduced in the second quarter has increased every month, Bass said, adding that California sales, which includes leased and purchased systems, rose in the third quarter compared with the second quarter.\nSunrun Chief Executive Lynn Jurich would not comment on her company's third quarter performance but said in an emailed statement that the industry “does face some headwinds from time to time that can include anything from seasonality to uncertainty created in consumers’ minds when we go through regulatory change.” \nSunrun believes there are five times as many “solar-ready homes” in California than have gone solar, Jurich added.\nBoth SolarCity and Sunrun have said new products, such as energy storage and the “solar roofs” SolarCity is expected to unveil later this week, will create new growth.\n\n (Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Sue Horton and Lisa

Nevada's state gambling regulator is investigating allegations that Las Vegas Sands Corp casinos allowed high-stakes Chinese players to bet millions of dollars in other people's names, according to people directly familiar with the investigation.\nThe Nevada Gaming Control Board \"has made inquiries related to this matter and we've responded in a timely and transparent matter, as we always do,\" said Ron Reese, a Sands spokesman.\nAs Las Vegas has sought to draw wealthy Chinese baccarat players, some casinos have allowed high-stakes players to gamble through frontmen who would sign the credit paperwork, a Reuters investigation published last month found.\nThe allegations against the Sands initially surfaced after Clark County prosecutors brought charges last year against two women accused of failing to repay millions of dollars in gambling debts at the Las Vegas Sands' Venetian and Palazzo casinos.\nAttorneys for the women, Jeffrey Setness and Kevin Rosenberg, said the two were actually shills -- local housekeepers recruited with the cooperation of Sands personnel to take out millions of dollars in credit in their own names. The women would then sit near the actual players, allowing them to use the chips and gamble millions of dollars without a paper trail, the attorneys said.\nPreviously, a Sands spokesman said the company had no clear evidence anyone from the company asked the women to take out credit in other people’s names.\nAfter the defense attorneys raised the counter-allegations, prosecutors dropped the charges this past spring during preliminary hearings in Las Vegas Justice Court.\nThe state's gambling regulator, the Nevada Gaming Control Board, is investigating those allegations and whether the use of fronts violates the state's bookkeeping regulations and broad \"decency\" requirements, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.\nIn recent years, state and federal authorities have scrutinized practices in Las Vegas casinos that allow gamblers to play without leaving a paper trail.\nThe Sands, for instance, paid $47 million in 2013 to settle a U.S. Department of Justice investigation after the discovery that an alleged Chinese–Mexican drug trafficker lost more than $84 million at the Venetian, according to a statement of facts the Sands agreed to as part of its settlement with the DOJ.\n\n (Editing by Ronnie
