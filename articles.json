[{"title":"Doctors' leaders call for prescription drug helpline","body":"Doctors' leaders are calling for the urgent introduction of a UK-wide 24-hour helpline for prescription drug dependence. \nThe British Medical Association (BMA) has said there should be more support for people coming off the drugs. \nBenzodiazepines - taken for severe anxiety, insomnia and sometimes pain relief - are a particular concern. \nPublic Health England said it supported local services to help address drug addiction issues. \nDr Andrew Green, the BMA's GP clinical and prescribing policy lead, told the BBC 5 live Investigates programme:  \"Establishing a national helpline should be a top priority to provide better service to individuals with prescribed drug dependence. \n\"There is also the need for specialist services to be consistently available across the country.\"\nHe added: \"Patients have not had their problems adequately recognised in the past and we need to put that right.\" \nThe BMA will publish its recommendations on Monday. It will also call for clear guidance for practitioners on helping people manage to cut down and stop taking prescription medications.\nJan Waterton, 62, from Cornwall, was first prescribed benzodiazepines in 1992 for pain relief following surgery on her hip. \nShe later realised she had become dependent.\n\"I collapsed in a heap in the bedroom, shaking, quaking; my husband thought I was having a breakdown.  That's when we first realised that I was totally addicted to the substance.\"\nShe said she suffered severe withdrawal symptoms during the 18 years it took her to fully come off the medication.\n\"I experienced massive electric shocks in the brain, twitching, numbness, feeling dreadful.\" \nFigures from NHS Digital show just over 10 million prescriptions for benzodiazepines were issued last year in England, 0.9 % of all prescriptions dispensed during 2015.  \nAccording to government guidance, the recommended maximum time for which benzodiazepines should be prescribed is four weeks, to reduce the risk of dependency. \nBut a BMA report, published last year, warned people were being prescribed them for longer. BBC 5 live Investigates has found cases of people using the drugs for decades. \nDr Green said they were effective \"but only for a short period of time\". \nHe added: \"When patients try and come off, they get withdrawal syndrome and that encourages them to keep taking them and doctors sometimes prescribe them longer than they ought to.\"\nAcademics at the University of Roehampton have carried out a study looking at long-term benzodiazepine use.\nAfter looking at the number of people on the drug at 13 GP surgeries in the north of England, they said that, if that pattern was repeated across the UK, there could be at least 266,000 benzodiazepine users.\nDr James Davies, who has worked on the study said: \"Long-term use and withdrawal is a very serious public health issue that requires more attention than it is currently receiving.\" \nA spokesman for the Department of Health in England said it was looking at GP prescribing trends, including for benzodiazepines.\nHe said helpline services already existed. \"Anyone who is concerned that they may be dependent on medicines which have been prescribed to them can get advice from their GP, a community pharmacist, the 111 helpline or the online NHS Choices service.\n\"In addition, the government's drugs information service, Talk to FRANK provides advice on how to access specialist drug treatment services, including services which help people who have a dependence on a medicine prescribed to them.\"\nMeanwhile, a Northern Ireland Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"The New Strategic Direction for Alcohol and Drugs (NSD) strategy specifically recognises the misuse of prescription drugs in the north of Ireland as a key issue and an action plan has been developed to address it.\"\nReceiving better information and raising awareness among professionals and the public are two of the points on the plan.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"We welcome the publication of the recommendations by the BMA, which we will consider in light of the work already under way on this issue and look at what further action can be taken locally.\"\nProf David Taylor, a spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said it did not support long-term use other than in \"exceptional circumstances\" where the benefits outweighed the risks for that patient - and that people should normally only take them for a few weeks.\nHe added: \"For patients taking them for longer periods, any withdrawal management needs to be undertaken carefully and at a reduction rate that is tolerable for the patient.\" \nRosanna O'Connor, director of alcohol, drugs, tobacco at Public Health England said it supported local authorities in developing the kinds of services they needed in their areas.\nShe added: \"It remains important that all health professionals make every contact count with patients and are alert to possible signs of misuse and dependence, including to prescribed drugs.\"\n5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live on Sunday 23

for UKIP leadership","body":"Suzanne Evans and Paul Nuttall have announced they are to run for the leadership of UKIP, with both promising to unite the troubled party.\nMs Evans said she would make the party less \"toxic\" and aim to occupy the \"common sense centre\" ground.\nMr Nuttall, like Ms Evans an ex-party chairman, said he was the man to \"bring the factions together\".\nHowever, interim leader Nigel Farage, speaking about Ms Evans, said: \"I won't be voting for her.\"\nThe party has been in turmoil since the referendum in June, when the UK voted to leave the EU.\nMr Farage stood down as leader at the start of July saying he had achieved his political ambition. His successor Diane James resigned earlier this month after only 18 days in the job - leading to Mr Farage's return as interim leader.\nLast week, Steven Woolfe, who had been one of the front-runners to replace Ms James, quit the party a few days after being involved in an altercation with fellow MEP Mike Hookem.\nMs Evans told \n that she hoped to \"pour oil on troubled water\" after there had been \"a bit too much testosterone\" in UKIP.\nShe said focusing on the centre ground meant \"not the wishy washy Lib Dem centre\" but a party capable of taking votes from both left and right.\nShe also accused leadership rival Raheem Kassam of seeking to take the party too far to the right and added: \"Our 2015 general election manifesto took the best of politics from the left and from the right\".\nPaul Nuttall described himself as the \"unity candidate\". Yet today's skirmishes show how much UKIP is riven by feuding factions. \nThis leadership contest is about much more than choosing an individual. \nIt's about deciding the future of a party which has been dominated for so long by Nigel Farage and focussed for years on getting - and winning - an EU referendum. \nWhile the next leader will want to make sure the government delivers the kind of Brexit UKIP wants, there are longer-term existential questions.\nThese are: how the party stays relevant, what positions it takes on all sorts of other policy areas, and where it places itself on the political spectrum. \nSo far, the signs are the battle for the future could be a bloody one.\nHowever, Mr Farage, speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, said she would not be receiving his vote, adding: \"I don't doubt she has ability, it's just a question of political direction and to kick off her campaign decrying one of the declared candidates is not what we needed.\"\nHe also dismissed Ms Evans' views that the party should be in the centre ground, saying: \"UKIP is a radical political party that pushes for change and needs to go on being a radical political party.\"\nMr Kassam responded to Ms Evans' accusation \n \"It is sad that 60 seconds after she launched her campaign on the BBC, Suzanne Evans attacked me and my thousands of supporters as 'far right'.\"\nIn a fuller email sent to Ms Evans, he added: \"I would hereby request that you cease referring to vast swatches of UKIP as 'far right' and embark upon a positive campaign, structured upon not who you are against, but what you are for.\"\nSpeaking to Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News, Mr Kassam also said he wanted to unite the party and added: \"I think now, especially after that incident with Steven Woolfe in the European Parliament, we have to say this has gone too far. \n\"We are all in the same party and if we wish to remain in the same party let's sit down around a table together.\" \nNominations in the current leadership election close on 31 October, with the eventual winner announced on 28 November. \nMr Nuttall said that he had decided to stand for the leadership after the troubles of the past few months, telling Andrew Neil on \n \"UKIP needs to come together. At the moment it is looking over the edge of a political cliff and it will either step off or step back. I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards.\"\nExplaining why, when he didn't stand for the leadership earlier in the year, Mr Nuttall said: \"I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.\n\"But that doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.\"\nHe added: \"We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.\"\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Person","OfficeHolder"],"matchingTokens":[0,1],"entityId":"Suzanne

beach died of starvation linked to a spinal abnormality, experts have said.\nThe juvenile female was discovered at the Holkham National Nature Reserve on the north Norfolk coast on Thursday. \nThe Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP) carried out a post-mortem examination on the beach to establish the cause of its death. \nPlans are in place to remove the carcass, the Holkham Estate said.  \n\"Evidence from the post-mortem examination indicates that the fin whale had developed a spinal abnormality, which had potentially limited the degree of movement and brought progressive wasting of muscles and death,\" Rob Deaville from the CSIP said.\n\"The degree of muscle-wasting appeared much more profound along the tail-stock, behind a 'hump', so we speculate that the spinal abnormality had limited the degree of movement in that region in particular, which would have impacted on the animal's ability to dive and feed. \n\"The spinal abnormality may have been congenital, but it is certainly possible that the whale may have survived an historical traumatic event.\"\nDr Ben Garrod, of Anglia Ruskin University, previously said that fin whales, the second largest group in the whale family, were more often seen in the deep ocean.\n\"Fin whales are rarely, if ever, seen in the North Sea and are instead found off the western British Isles.\"\n","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"Fin","confidenceScore":2.051,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin","matchedText":"fin","freebaseId":"/m/02zg_","relevanceScore":0.3977,"entityEnglishId":"Fin","startingPos":2,"endingPos":5,"wikidataId":"Q778612"},{"id":1,"type":["Species","Eukaryote","Animal","Mammal"],"matchingTokens":[1,2],"entityId":"Fin

poet who has autism explains why the condition is not a barrier to working as a live performer.\n\"Autism isn't just about being introverted, it's about finding ordinary social interactions difficult,\" says Harry Giles, an award-winning Scottish poet who has Asperger's syndrome. \n\"Sometimes in social situations I won't know what the rules are, or I might get them a bit wrong sometimes and get anxious.\"\nDespite facing these challenges, Harry, who was born in Orkney and now lives in Edinburgh, earns a living performing self-written poetry on stages across the UK.\nFor Harry, it is more comfortable to stand under a spotlight projecting poetry to a room full of strangers than it is to sit among them - but why? \n\"Because onstage - I'm in charge. I set the rules,\" the performer says.\n\"It's a much calmer situation than when there is a lot of people talking at once and my brain is trying to understand what they are all saying and what all the different social relationships are.\"\nHarry's performance skills have been honed since the poet was a child.\n\"I've always had to be a sort of performer, because when I am feeling really anxious in conversations - I have to fake that I understand the rules,\" the poet says.\n\"I think it became natural that I took a skill I had to develop to survive and turned it into an artistic thing.\"\nThe poet says that while writing and performing is enjoyable, the business side of being in the entertainment industry can be more challenging, as it involves networking at various social events. \nSource: \n\"A lot of where the business of arts happens is in the pub after the event and I just can't do that stuff,\" Harry says.\n\"I can cope with one of those events a month and have to really build up my will to do it, and give myself recovery time afterwards.\"\n\"The more noise there is, the more my brain shuts down and I stop being able to speak; and if am getting really stressed, I am likely to have a panic attack.\n\"My brain does the mental equivalent of a hedgehog curling into a ball.\" \nThe issue is not that Harry dislikes social events - it's just that they can sometimes be challenging.\n\"It's not to do with desire or preference - it's to do with ability and disability,\" says the poet.\nFor Harry it is easier to network online than in person, \"because words in emails and blogs can be planned in advance\".\nBefore signing a publishing deal with Freight Books, it was essential for the poet to build up an audience online.\nBut it is difficult for Harry to earn a substantial amount of money from publishing, so to earn a living, the poet must be booked regularly for live performances.\nSometimes this can involve cold calling performance venues, something that can be difficult for a person with Asperger's syndrome.\n\"I find that [cold calling] the hardest,\" Harry says.\n\"It's terrifying to phone up a stranger and say 'do you want to book me and my art?'\"\nFor years, Harry stubbornly avoided seeking an autism diagnosis.\n\"I'm independent minded and suspicious of authority,\" the poet says.\nBut since being diagnosed last year, the writer has felt some sense of relief.\n\"I've become more forgiving of myself,\" Harry says.\n\"There can be a cycle of shame and guilt associated with having social anxiety, but my diagnosis has stopped me feeling guilty because I know why I find things hard - it's because I am autistic.\" \nSince the diagnosis, Harry's relationships have improved, as the poet has become more self-aware about the reasons behind certain behaviours.\n\"All my relationships have got better since I started thinking about myself that way, because I started noticing when I do things that are a bit weird,\" the poet says.\n\"My current partner is extremely accepting and supportive.\"\nHarry identifies as being non-binary - any gender that is not exclusively male or female. \nBeing LGBT and autistic, Harry adds that it can be difficult to find supportive peers from either community who really understand both personality aspects.\n\"Clubs and bars are really important historically to the LGBT community as a space of organisation, self-discovery and identity - but they are just so inaccessible to people with autism,\" the poet says.\n\"On the other hand, autism historically has been under-diagnosed in women and LGBT people.\n\"This means that autism self-advocacy organisations tend to be quite male, quite straight, and not always good at understanding LGBT people.\"\nHowever, the poet says that some LGBT autism groups have formed recently in Scotland, \"which is really encouraging.\"\nAs Harry has got older, the symptoms of autism have become less pronounced, as the poet has refined coping strategies that help manage the condition.\n\"My autism is often not really visible to people because I've found new ways of dealing with it,\" Harry says.\n\"For example, I don't find small talk hard anymore - I used to find it difficult, but I discovered there is actually quite a simple set of rules you can deploy if you learn them.\n\"It might not come naturally, but I can say 'och, it's a nice day' or 'och, it's a dreich day', and someone else will say 'oh, yeah it is', and I'll say 'how are you?'\" \nWhile Harry enjoys projecting poetry on the stage, the performer would not self-describe

Observer” section of Donald Trump’s campaign website reportedly trains supporters to spot any suspicious skin colors they may see on Election Day, sources confirmed this week. “Keep an eye out for any of the skin tones appearing on the list below, none of which are allowable on November 8,” read the webpage in part, reminding volunteers that watching out for certain suspect and disreputable complexions was the only way to ensure the Republican nominee had a fair shot at winning the election. “Be on the lookout for these two shades in particular, as they have historically proven to cause significant trouble. And remember that whenever you spot a dubious-looking skin pigmentation at your polling place, immediately confront the problem head-on.” The site further stated that should a volunteer happen to notice a significantly high number of suspicious skin colors at their precinct, they should call their local Trump field office immediately so the campaign could formally contest the polling location’s results.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[25],"entityId":"Donald

to the Republican nominee who strode up to his table during the third presidential debate Wednesday, moderator Chris Wallace is said to have received a cease-and-desist letter from the Trump Organization in the middle of asking Donald Trump to respond to allegations that he groped multiple women. “Are you Chris Wallace? This is for you,” said the Trump Organization representative, handing the Fox News host a letter from Trump’s lawyer Marc Kasowitz, which threatened legal action over “reckless, slanderous, and defamatory statements made by Chris Wallace at the presidential debate on October 19, 2016,” and stated that “the timing of these statements moments ago during a nationally televised broadcast makes it clear that this is a politically motivated attempt to harm Mr. Trump’s candidacy.” “If you fail to comply with this order, Mr. Wallace, we’ll have no choice but to sue. Good day.” The Trump Organization official reportedly rushed back onstage moments later after Wallace asked the GOP nominee how much federal income tax he has paid over the past 20 years, serving the moderator a restraining order that barred him from having any contact with Trump for the remainder of the debate.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Company"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"PARADISE","freebaseTypes":["/organization/organization"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"PARADISE","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":0,"endingPos":8},{"id":1,"matchingTokens":[11],"entityId":"Candidate","freebaseTypes":["/people/appointed_role"],"confidenceScore":1.262,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate","matchedText":"nominee","freebaseId":"/m/02wwvy","relevanceScore":0.1472,"entityEnglishId":"Candidate","startingPos":54,"endingPos":61,"wikidataId":"Q618536"},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[21,22],"entityId":"United

presidential election by seven months to give Americans the opportunity to better get to know the presidential candidates. “We believe the continuation of this election by just over half a year will provide Americans with the chance to fully acquaint themselves with both the character and policy positions of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump,” said FEC chairman Matthew S. Petersen, who expressed confidence that the American people would benefit greatly from over 200 extra days of election coverage, rallies, press conferences, and campaign ads. “Our commission has also worked with the CPD to schedule eight more presidential debates and three more town halls, so that there will be no question that every citizen is ready to cast their ballot by the time Election Day comes around on June 8, 2017.” The FEC added that it had not ruled out extending the election by an additional year if any U.S. voters were still undecided.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement","City"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Washington,

the population of Heaven is composed of total assholes who begged for God’s forgiveness at the last moment before dying. “Our data show that 50 percent of the inhabitants of the Heavenly Kingdom were total pricks and sleazebags on Earth who waited until their very final breath to plead with God for mercy,” said report co-author Janet Ryder, adding that a survey of celestial records confirmed that one of every two residents of the eternal paradise willfully lived sinful existences and shamelessly committed immoral acts before seeking clemency in the closing seconds of their lives. “What we found particularly interesting is that those who truly committed themselves to God by leading lives of virtue and doing good works are actually outnumbered by hate-filled scoundrels, petty criminals, and murderers who humbled themselves before the Lord and turned from their wicked ways at the last possible moment to con their way into Heaven.” The report also confirmed that 28 percent of the inhabitants of Hell had only sinned once or twice but never had an opportunity to repent.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"WASHINGTON","freebaseTypes":["/location/location"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"WASHINGTON","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":0,"endingPos":10},{"id":1,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[9,10],"entityId":"2016-10-24T00:00:00.000-04:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Monday,","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":57,"endingPos":64},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[16],"entityId":"Heaven","freebaseTypes":["/media_common/quotation_subject","/book/book_subject","/film/film_subject"],"confidenceScore":7.152,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven","matchedText":"Heaven","freebaseId":"/m/03ld5","relevanceScore":0.4576,"entityEnglishId":"Heaven","startingPos":96,"endingPos":102,"wikidataId":"Q4489450"},{"id":3,"matchingTokens":[25],"entityId":"God","freebaseTypes":["/fictional_universe/person_in_fiction","/book/book_subject","/film/film_subject","/religion/deity","/fictional_universe/character_species"],"confidenceScore":11.06,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God","matchedText":"God","freebaseId":"/m/0d05l6","relevanceScore":0.2616,"entityEnglishId":"God","startingPos":148,"endingPos":151,"wikidataId":"Q190"},{"id":4,"matchingTokens":[27],"entityId":"Forgiveness","freebaseTypes":["/book/book_subject","/media_common/quotation_subject","/film/film_subject"],"confidenceScore":2.096,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgiveness","matchedText":"forgiveness","freebaseId":"/m/01klvz","relevanceScore":0.4639,"entityEnglishId":"Forgiveness","startingPos":154,"endingPos":165,"wikidataId":"Q537963"},{"id":5,"matchingTokens":[47,48],"entityId":"Heaven","freebaseTypes":["/media_common/quotation_subject","/book/book_subject","/film/film_subject"],"confidenceScore":1.647,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven","matchedText":"Heavenly

regime and rebel forces in Syria’s divided city of \n after a three-day “humanitarian” ceasefire expired before the UN could evacuate wounded civilians from rebel-held areas.\nNeither rebels nor residents of opposition-held districts heeded calls from Syria’s army and Moscow to leave during the ceasefire, after weeks of devastating bombardment and a three-month government siege.\nSyrian state media and Russian authorities have accused rebel forces of preventing civilians from leaving and of using them as human shields.\nAlmost 500 people have been killed and more than 2,000 civilians wounded since the army launched its offensive to drive the rebels out of the eastern districts they have held since 2012. \nThe UN had hoped to use the ceasefire to evacuate seriously wounded people and possibly deliver aid. But a UN official said on Saturday the requisite security guarantees had not been received.\n“You have various parties to the conflict and those with influence and they all have to be on the same page on this and they are not,” said David Swanson, a spokesman for the UN humanitarian office.\nNo additional aid was delivered, leaving the beleaguered rebel-held eastern part of the city without any immediate sign of western help. No aid has entered Aleppo since 7 July and food rations will run out by the end of the month, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has warned.\nThree people were wounded by shelling of the rebel-held Salaheddin and Mashhad districts on Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, adding that the first airstrikes since the end of the truce hit the opposition-controlled district of Sheikh Saeed, where there was also heavy fighting.\nFierce fighting between rebels and Syrian government forces also started along a strategic frontline in south-west Aleppo that in the past has been used to break the siege.\n opened eight corridors for evacuations during the ceasefire, but just a handful of people crossed through a single passage.\nNo fighters with Jabhat Fateh al-Sham – one of the most powerful jihadi groups in \n – left the city, a key demand of the Russian government. Russia has insisted that moderate rebels disassociate themselves from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front) and encourage them to leave the city.\nAccording to the UN data, there are about 8,000 moderate opposition fighters in Aleppo and about 900 Jabhat Fateh al-Sham militants. Both Russia and the west regard the militants, who have links to al-Qaida, as a legitimate target in the Syrian civil war.\nThe Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel alliance, which has said it is preparing for a big attack to break the siege, warned residents in and around the city to stay away from government and military buildings for their own safety in a statement on Saturday. FSA rebel groups said they had repelled various offensives by government forces.\nThe French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, called for fresh economic sanctions to be imposed on Syria after a UN report released on Friday found that \n for a third time.\nAyrault, speaking on Saturday, said: “I want ... a clear condemnation of these crimes in a resolution from the UN security council ... that places the perpetrators under sanctions.”\nThe UN report said the Syrian army had attacked a village with chemical weapons in 2015. Islamic State has also been accused of using mustard gas as a weapon.\n“The Syrian army and Daesh [Isis] have used chemical weapons against civilians on at least three occasions,” Ayrault said. “These acts are inhuman and unacceptable.”\nHe called on UN security council members to “assume their responsibilities”.\nA European Union attempt to impose a fresh round of economic sanctions against Russia over its attack on Aleppo failed on Friday following \n. \nResponding to the UN report, the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said: “The use of chemical weapons is horrific, and a breach of international law and UN security council resolutions. It is crucial to hold those responsible to account.”\nIt is likely that Russia would veto any sanctions against \n at the UN, arguing the UN evidence is not conclusive. The latest set of events leave no prospect of a way out after almost every diplomatic avenue has been explored.\nRussia is now focusing its diplomatic efforts on Turkey, Qatar, the US and Saudi Arabia, excluding Britain, Germany and France on the basis that they have less direct influence over fighters on the ground.\nRussia is a key ally of Syria’s government and began a military intervention in support of President Bashar al-Assad last September. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday the intervention was meant to “liberate” Syria and keep Assad in power.\n“Either Assad is in Damascus or [Jabhat Fateh al-Sham] is,” he said. “There is no third option here.”\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said earlier that both rebels and regime forces appeared to be reinforcing their positions.\nThe head of the SOHR, Rami Abdulrahman, said: “The regime and the rebels are both bolstering their forces, which raises fears of a massive military operation.”

bought by her lover Lord Nelson to go on display\n","body":"A voluptuous portrait of Emma Hamilton, commissioned by her husband and later bought by her lover Lord Nelson to save it from the shame of a public sale, is to be displayed in a major exhibition on her extraordinary life.\n“She was a really remarkable person, who has usually been seen only in the shadows of the men in her life. It is time to bring her back into the light,” said Quintin Colville, curator of the exhibition that opens at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, next month.\nThe portrait has been in private collections since it was completed, and has not been exhibited in the UK for almost half a century.\nColville, like many men before him, has fallen heavily for Hamilton, the blacksmith’s daughter who became an aristocratic diplomat’s wife and the mistress of one of the most famous men of the day. He told the Guardian he finds it hard to forgive the artist, Élisabeth Louise \n, for being so rude about Hamilton, who had been typically kind to her when Vigée Le Brun came to the Naples court as a refugee from the French Revolution.\nHamilton was far more famous in that circle than Vigée Le Brun, and was renowned for her “attitudes”, theatrical exhibitions of poses drawn from classical art and literature, including Lord Hamilton’s famous collection of Greek vases. Her performances were essential viewing for visitors to Naples, including the German writer \n, who described her as “exceedingly beautiful”, and said she brought the ancient world to life “as if one were in some dream”.\n In 1791, Lord Hamilton took the then Emma Hart as his mistress from his nephew and then married her when he was 61 and she was 26. The blacksmith’s daughter became Lady Hamilton, an ambassador’s wife and society hostess. Many regarded the match as shocking, but it was nothing to the scandal that followed. When a wounded Nelson came to convalesce in Naples, Lady Hamilton nursed him back to health and the two fell passionately in love. Instead of throwing her out and challenging Nelson to a duel, Lord Hamilton remained on affectionate terms with both of them.\n“Hamilton greatly admired Nelson, and he was unquestionably extremely fond of Emma. He didn’t want to lose her, he was getting old, and I think he wanted a comfortable life spending time with his collections and his books, surrounded by people he liked,” Colville said.\nThe portrait shows Lady Hamilton as either a bacchante or Ariadne, daughter of King Minos of Crete in Greek mythology. Colville notes her expression of sleepy satisfaction, and the little ship sailing away in the background, and wonders if there is a sly reference to Nelson.\nVigée Le Brun went on to paint many more highly saleable portraits of Hamilton – who was already the muse and favourite model of \n – and said of her: “I could have copied her different poses ... and filled a gallery with paintings.”\nHowever, she also wrote in her diary: “Lady Hamilton was not very intelligent, though she was exceedingly mocking and denigrating, to the point that her faults were her only means of conversation. But she was cunning, and this helped her to snare a husband.”\nThe exhibition will include many loans from private collections, including touchingly modest objects that belonged to Lady Hamilton, which have never been displayed before. Almost everything she owned was scattered in sales after Nelson died at Trafalgar in 1805, two years after Lord Hamilton. She ended up poorer than when she was born, having been released from a debtor’s prison to die penniless in Calais in 1815.\nThe objects will include a little needle book with nautical scenes owned by Horatia, her daughter by Nelson, and a devotional book she gave her, inscribed “a life well spent makes old age pleasant and honourable”, but signed “Emma Hamilton” rather than as her mother.\nBoth Lord Hamilton and Nelson loved the Vigée Le Brun portrait. Lord Hamilton left a miniature version to Nelson in his will, “a very small token of the great regard I have for his Lordship, the most virtuous, loyal and truly brave character I ever met with”. Nelson, when he learned the original was to be sold, wrote to Lady Hamilton: “My dearest friend you are on SALE: I am almost mad to think of the iniquity.” He paid £300 for it, and kept it over his bed for the rest of his life.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[2],"entityId":"Portrait","freebaseTypes":["/book/book_subject","/media_common/quotation_subject","/business/employer","/business/business_location","/visual_art/visual_art_genre","/exhibitions/exhibition_subject"],"confidenceScore":4.096,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait","matchedText":"portrait","freebaseId":"/m/01dv4h","relevanceScore":0.2321,"entityEnglishId":"Portrait","startingPos":13,"endingPos":21,"wikidataId":"Q134307"},{"id":1,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[4,5],"entityId":"Emma,

describes staircase collapse at Irish theme park\n","body":"A woman has told how she stepped off a theme park staircase in \n just moments before it collapsed, sending parents and children crashing to the ground.\nA number of people were injured inside the house of horrors attraction at Tayto Park on Saturday night when a section of stairs gave way. Nine were taken to hospital.\nIt happened at about 8pm during a Halloween-themed event at the park in County Meath.\nIt is understood no one was seriously injured, with the majority sustaining cuts and bruises. A spokeswoman for the park said people were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure\nRian O’Kelly said she visited the site with her 13-year-old sister and her two young friends.\nThe 25-year-old from Dublin said the stairway was in two sections and she had just stepped on to the middle landing when the stairs behind her vanished from sight.\n“We heard this big creaking noise and we thought it was part of the show, like trying to be scary, but then, next of all, people directly behind us just dropped and the whole staircase collapsed,” she said.\n“Obviously everyone got really afraid and everyone started crying and screaming and stuff and running because we thought we were going to drop down as well, because we had just stepped off that staircase and everyone behind us just had gone.”\nEmergency services attended the scene and Ireland’s Health and Safety Authority has launched an investigation.\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Ulster’s Sunday News programme, O’Kelly said: “It was a family event – there were grown men and younger children on the stairs. There was definitely a lot of people injured from it.\n“We basically just saw everyone behind us just suddenly drop and they all landed on top of each other and the staircase completely gave way.\n“All the younger children, and adults even, were screaming and crying. It really was very scary and quite ironic, that we were supposed to be going into a house of horrors.”\nThe park at Ashbourne, which is themed on the famous Irish crisp brand Tayto, opened in 2010.\nThe venue said in a statement on Sunday: “Last night at approximately 8pm the lower portion of a permanent staircase leading to the House of Horrors gave way.\n“The Tayto Park emergency plan was immediately put in place and the emergency services attended the scene. Nine people were transported to hospitals in the city as a precautionary measure to assess their injuries.\n“The management of Tayto Park will cooperate fully with the investigation as the safety of our guests is paramount.”\nThe park reopened on Sunday.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[9,10],"entityId":"Amusement

must present a united face to the world after Brexit\n","body":"o much of what we see around us here and abroad is about highlighting the differences between us and building barriers around our borders to keep people of different faiths and cultures out of our country. We hear politicians promoting divisions and igniting fires of hatred to advance their own cause. We witnessed strong rhetoric around the campaign to leave Europe that has directly translated into violence against minorities and immigrants.\nThen we hear the home secretary wanting organisations to \n. And the health secretary wants more \n. What message does this government want to give immigrants who have made Britain their home? Is this the modern-day Britain we want the world to see? It’s not the Britain we have become accustomed to living in. And it is not going to help build bridges with new economic partners from India and China.\nIt has taken decades of hard work to foster good race relations and achieve so much in an effort to make our society fairer, to provide equality for all and to ensure discrimination is dealt with appropriately. Change is the only constant in life. But change has to make our society better. We must learn from mistakes made throughout history and ensure we don’t go backwards and cut ourselves off from the world.\nWhen we look at society, we are surrounded by heroes. People who have excelled in their chosen line of work. People who do amazing things such as saving lives and defending our freedoms. We don’t see surgeons refusing to operate on patients because they are brown, black or white. These are the real-life heroes. Heroes who make our world better. And this is why the \n are so important so we can recognise their great work and take a moment to say thank you for all that you have done.\nIt should come as no surprise that more diverse companies and institutions are achieving better performance\nWe are proud of people like the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who won the \n. The son of a bus driver who grew up on a council estate has shown everyone what we as minorities can achieve. What a great message his victory sent around the world. That the people of one of the greatest cities in the world have elected a Muslim mayor.\nAs we celebrate his victory we know there are tough times ahead as Britain negotiates its exit from Europe. Politicians are looking for new friends and seeking trade deals to ensure our prosperity as a nation is unhindered. There is absolutely no doubt that commerce and trade will be a very important part of the equation and private sector organisations will be required to generate employment and wealth to prevent the UK from going into recession.\nOrganisations with a diverse leadership team can capitalise on these opportunities with speed. It should come as no surprise that more diverse companies and institutions are achieving better performance. Diversity matters because we live in a world that has become deeply interconnected.\nWhen we go to work we pick up a newspaper from an Asian-owned newsagent. We come home late and pick up a meal from an Indian or Chinese takeaway. We have a cold and pick up medicine from an Asian-owned pharmacy. The NHS survives on the invaluable contribution from doctors, surgeons, dentists and nurses from the Asian, black and European communities. More than half of construction workers building London’s new homes are from Europe. This is the Britain we know and this is the Britain we want to excel in the 21st century, leading the way with talent from all communities to engineer space travel, build driverless cars and save lives. So let’s embrace change and unite to help each other achieve greater success together.Division weakens us – but in unity there is strength.\nEastern

Kurds claim capture of town in advance on Mosul","body":" Kurdish fighters said they had taken the town of Bashiqa near Mosul from Islamic State on Sunday as coalition forces pressed their offensive against the jihadists' last stronghold in Iraq.\nMasoud Barzani, President of the Iraqi Kurdish region, told U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter that the Kurds had succeeded in liberating Bashiqa from Islamic State.\nKurdish Peshmerga fighters told reporters at the scene that they had entered Bashiqa. Journalists were not being allowed into the town, which lies 12 km (8 miles) northeast of Mosul. \nThe offensive to take Mosul, by Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition, is expected to become the biggest battle in the country since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. \nThe capture of Bashiqa, if confirmed, would mark the removal of one more obstacle on the road to the northern city. \nThe top U.S. commander in Iraq, Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said his own information - while limited - \"suggests that President Barzani is right, that there has been a considerable success at Bashiqa\". \nBut he added: \"I have not received a report that says every house has been cleared, every Daesh (Islamic State fighter) has been killed and every IED (roadside bomb) has been removed.\" \nTownsend told journalists that Bashiqa was one of the villages outside Mosul that Islamic State had emptied of civilians and fortified over the past two years.\nReuters television footage from Nawran, a town near Bashiqa, showed Kurdish fighters using a heavy mortar, a machine gun and small arms as smoke rose over the area.\nAs Peshmerga forces moved though the area, armored vehicles moved along a road and a helicopter flew overhead.\nThe Peshmerga are also using tanks, rocket launchers and snipers. A Reuters photographer saw the fighters destroy at least three suicide car bombs dispatched against their forces.\nTurkish artillery is supporting the Peshmerga, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was quoted as saying by CNN Turk and other media outlets. \n\"The Peshmerga have mobilized to cleanse the Bashiqa region from Daesh. They asked for help from our soldiers at the Bashiqa base. So we are helping the tanks with our artillery there,\" CNN Turk quoted him as saying. \nTurkey has troops at a base in the area where it has been helping to train Iraqi Kurdish fighters. The artillery support could further strain relations between Ankara and the Baghdad central government, coming a day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declined an offer from Turkey to take part in the Mosul campaign.    \nMOSUL DRIVE\nThe offensive to capture Mosul started on Monday. Coalition forces have advanced to within 5 km (3 miles) of the city at the closest point, the interior minister of the Kurdish regional government has said.\nAn Iraqi force of about 30,000, joined by U.S. special forces and under American, French and British air cover, is ready to push into Mosul after recapturing Falluja and Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and seizing the Sunni stronghold of Tikrit in central Iraq.\nIslamic State have staged attacks apparently aimed at distracting the advancing forces. They hit the city of Kirkuk on Friday and on Sunday they attacked Rutba, a town 360 km (225 miles) west of Baghdad, where they killed at least seven policemen, according to a police source.\nThe mayor, Imad al-Dulaimi, said the insurgents attacked during the night and gained entry to the town by coordinating with sleeper cells there. About 30 insurgents skirmished with tribal fighters and security forces before vanishing.\nTownsend said Islamic State had staged what he called a complex attack in Rutba, which was being dealt with by Iraqi forces. The attack was intended \"to try to draw our attention from Mosul\", he said. \nIn an attempt to repel the offensive against Mosul, Islamic State also set fire to a sulfur plant near the city. Up to 1,000 people were treated in hospital after inhaling toxic fumes.\nEXPLOSIVES\nCoalition officials have said the offensive is going well, but that it will take a long time to recapture Mosul, which has a civilian population of 1.5 million.\nBetween 4,000 and 8,000 Islamic State fighters have rigged the city with explosives, built oil-filled moats, dug tunnels, and trenches and are feared to be ready to use civilians as human shields.\nCarter sounded optimistic about the campaign to take Mosul during a trip to Erbil as he praised the Kurdish region's Peshmerga fighters. \n\"I'm here to commend you and your forces. I’m encouraged by what I see,\" Carter told Barzani during talks.\nPeshmerga spokesman Brigadier General Halgord Hekmet told reporters that 25 Kurdish forces had been killed so far.\n\"There (are) a lot of wounded,\" Hekmet said, speaking through a translator. He spoke positively about air support his forces were receiving from the coalition but said more military assistance was needed, starting with armored vehicles and equipment to detect roadside bombs.\n\"Most of our Peshmerga got killed because they were riding in regular cars, not armored,\" Hekmet said. \nDuring the meeting, Barzani said the Mosul operation had started successfully and cited good progress over the past three days. He thanked the United States and the coalition for their support.\nIn Rome, Pope Francis said he was close to the Iraqi people and in particular to the citizens of Mosul.\n\"Our souls are shaken by the brutal acts of violence that for too long have been carried out against innocent citizens, be they Muslim, Christian or from other ethnic and religious groups.\"  \nHe had been saddened by reports that numerous people, including many children, had been \"killed in cold blood\". \n (Additional reporting by Phil Stewart, Bushra Shakhshir, Silvia Aloisi, Yesim Dikmen and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Writing by

wind for stocks as earnings turn positive","body":" With S&P 500 earnings on track to rise after four consecutive quarters of contraction, U.S. stocks are clearing a major hurdle that puts the record high in sight for the benchmark U.S. stock index.\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high in mid August even after the long profit slump. The index has trended lower since then, and even closed below its 50-day average for most of the last six weeks. Some analysts have  blamed the recent weakness on expectations that earnings would again fail to grow, as estimates showed until early this week.\nBut stronger-than-expected profit reports from companies such as Microsoft (\n) and Bank of America (\n) have turned the tide and the blended earnings growth estimate for the third quarter sits now at 1.1 percent. This would effectively end the earnings recession.\n\"The magnitude of the beats we’ve had is really important,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.\n\"There’s a much larger chance that we break out of range to the upside than the downside and I think it happens before the end of the year,\" he said.     \nThe end-of-year seasonality is also on the side of stock bulls.\nData from broker-dealer LPL Financial show that since 1980 the median S&P 500 gain in the last 50 trading days of the year is 3.6 percent, an advance that would see the index end the year near 2,200 and above its current record close of 2,190.15. It closed Friday at 2,141.16.\n\"With the earnings recession showing signs of ending this quarter, the economy is on firmer footing, which could lead to your typical end of year strength,” said LPL's senior market strategist Ryan Detrick.\nThe energy sector, which had been a large weight on S&P earnings, is leading the index in terms of the magnitude of upbeat surprises. \nEarly in the reporting season, profits for the sector are coming in 18 percent above expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, ahead of the 11 percent surprise factor in financials and an average of 7 percent for the S&P 500.\nThe strong beats bode well ahead of a week heavy in energy sector reports including its two largest companies, Exxon Mobil (\n) and Chevron (\n), on Friday.\nSome energy companies have been able to profit even amid a steep slump in oil prices, noted Roberto Friedlander, head of energy trading at Seaport Global Securities in New York.\nHe said in a Friday email that the magnitude of strong earnings surprises in the energy space was partly because investors had failed \"to truly gauge how efficient and quickly the sector has been able to come down the cost curve and lower break-evens.\"\nS&P 500 energy .SPNY is the leading sector in terms of year-to-date gains, up 15.3 percent in 2016. The only two other sectors up double digits are utilities .SPLRCU, up 10.8 percent, and technology .SPLRCT, up 11.2 percent.\nThe change in leadership to energy is \"an important transition\" and an indication that the economy is in stronger footing, said Wunderlich's Hogan.\n\"People are getting out of defensives and looking into growth.\"\n (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos, additional reporting by

Hillary Clinton maintained her commanding lead in the race to win the Electoral College and claim the U.S. presidency, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project results released on Saturday.\nIn the last week, there has been little movement. Clinton leads Donald Trump in most of the states that Trump would need should he have a chance to win the minimum 270 votes needed to win. According to the project, she has a better than 95 percent chance of winning, if the election was held this week. The mostly likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump.\nTrump came off his best debate performance of the campaign Wednesday evening but the polling consensus still showed Clinton winning the third and final face-off on prime-time TV. Trump disputes those findings.\nAnd some national polls had the race tightening a wee bit this week though others had Clinton maintaining her solid lead. But the project illustrates that the broader picture remains bleak for Trump with 17 days to go until the Nov. 8 election. \nTrump did gain ground in South Carolina where his slim lead last week expanded to seven points, moving it into his column from a toss-up. Unfortunately for him, he lost ground in Arizona, which is now too close to call.\nAdditionally, he is facing a challenge for Utah’s six Electoral College votes from former CIA operative and Utah native Evan McMullin. The independent candidate is siphoning votes away from Trump in a state that is Republican as any in the nation. In some polls, McMullin is even leading. (The States of the Nation is not polling on McMullin.)\nUtah, like almost all of the states, is a winner-take-all contest.\nClinton has also maintained a lead in Florida and Pennsylvania, which have a combined 49 Electoral College votes. Ohio remains too close to call.\nAccording to the project, lower voter turnout generally benefits Trump but his best hope for success is if Republican turnout surges and Democratic turnout is low.\nTo examine these results and other scenarios, go to the States of the Nation project \n .\n (Editing by Bernard Orr)\n","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"Candidate","freebaseTypes":["/people/appointed_role"],"confidenceScore":0.9779,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate","matchedText":"candidate","freebaseId":"/m/02wwvy","relevanceScore":0.2533,"entityEnglishId":"Candidate","startingPos":12,"endingPos":21,"wikidataId":"Q618536"},{"id":1,"matchingTokens":[14,15],"entityId":"Electoral
