autistic people be extroverts?","body":"A poet who has autism explains why the condition is not a barrier to working as a live performer.\n\"Autism isn't just about being introverted, it's about finding ordinary social interactions difficult,\" says Harry Giles, an award-winning Scottish poet who has Asperger's syndrome. \n\"Sometimes in social situations I won't know what the rules are, or I might get them a bit wrong sometimes and get anxious.\"\nDespite facing these challenges, Harry, who was born in Orkney and now lives in Edinburgh, earns a living performing self-written poetry on stages across the UK.\nFor Harry, it is more comfortable to stand under a spotlight projecting poetry to a room full of strangers than it is to sit among them - but why? \n\"Because onstage - I'm in charge. I set the rules,\" the performer says.\n\"It's a much calmer situation than when there is a lot of people talking at once and my brain is trying to understand what they are all saying and what all the different social relationships are.\"\nHarry's performance skills have been honed since the poet was a child.\n\"I've always had to be a sort of performer, because when I am feeling really anxious in conversations - I have to fake that I understand the rules,\" the poet says.\n\"I think it became natural that I took a skill I had to develop to survive and turned it into an artistic thing.\"\nThe poet says that while writing and performing is enjoyable, the business side of being in the entertainment industry can be more challenging, as it involves networking at various social events. \nSource: \nNHS\n\"A lot of where the business of arts happens is in the pub after the event and I just can't do that stuff,\" Harry says.\n\"I can cope with one of those events a month and have to really build up my will to do it, and give myself recovery time afterwards.\"\n\"The more noise there is, the more my brain shuts down and I stop being able to speak; and if am getting really stressed, I am likely to have a panic attack.\n\"My brain does the mental equivalent of a hedgehog curling into a ball.\" \nThe issue is not that Harry dislikes social events - it's just that they can sometimes be challenging.\n\"It's not to do with desire or preference - it's to do with ability and disability,\" says the poet.\nFor Harry it is easier to network online than in person, \"because words in emails and blogs can be planned in advance\".\nBefore signing a publishing deal with Freight Books, it was essential for the poet to build up an audience online.\nBut it is difficult for Harry to earn a substantial amount of money from publishing, so to earn a living, the poet must be booked regularly for live performances.\nSometimes this can involve cold calling performance venues, something that can be difficult for a person with Asperger's syndrome.\n\"I find that [cold calling] the hardest,\" Harry says.\n\"It's terrifying to phone up a stranger and say 'do you want to book me and my art?'\"\nFor years, Harry stubbornly avoided seeking an autism diagnosis.\n\"I'm independent minded and suspicious of authority,\" the poet says.\nBut since being diagnosed last year, the writer has felt some sense of relief.\n\"I've become more forgiving of myself,\" Harry says.\n\"There can be a cycle of shame and guilt associated with having social anxiety, but my diagnosis has stopped me feeling guilty because I know why I find things hard - it's because I am autistic.\" \nSince the diagnosis, Harry's relationships have improved, as the poet has become more self-aware about the reasons behind certain behaviours.\n\"All my relationships have got better since I started thinking about myself that way, because I started noticing when I do things that are a bit weird,\" the poet says.\n\"My current partner is extremely accepting and supportive.\"\nHarry identifies as being non-binary - any gender that is not exclusively male or female. \nBeing LGBT and autistic, Harry adds that it can be difficult to find supportive peers from either community who really understand both personality aspects.\n\"Clubs and bars are really important historically to the LGBT community as a space of organisation, self-discovery and identity - but they are just so inaccessible to people with autism,\" the poet says.\n\"On the other hand, autism historically has been under-diagnosed in women and LGBT people.\n\"This means that autism self-advocacy organisations tend to be quite male, quite straight, and not always good at understanding LGBT people.\"\nHowever, the poet says that some LGBT autism groups have formed recently in Scotland, \"which is really encouraging.\"\nAs Harry has got older, the symptoms of autism have become less pronounced, as the poet has refined coping strategies that help manage the condition.\n\"My autism is often not really visible to people because I've found new ways of dealing with it,\" Harry says.\n\"For example, I don't find small talk hard anymore - I used to find it difficult, but I discovered there is actually quite a simple set of rules you can deploy if you learn them.\n\"It might not come naturally, but I can say 'och, it's a nice day' or 'och, it's a dreich day', and someone else will say 'oh, yeah it is', and I'll say 'how are you?'\" \nWhile Harry enjoys projecting poetry on the stage, the performer would not self-describe as an \"extrovert\", because in social situations the writer is \"far more likely to be in a corner, looking at a phone\".\n\"The majority of autistic people I've met tend to adapt quite well quite quickly to stages,\" the poet adds.\n\"But we often don't get a chance to go on a stage because people assume we will be crap at it.\"\n\"It's a difference, not a deficiency.\"\n","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"Poet","freebaseTypes":["/fictional_universe/character_occupation","/media_common/quotation_subject","/book/book_subject","/people/profession"],"confidenceScore":2.198,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet","matchedText":"poet","freebaseId":"/m/05z96","relevanceScore":0.1607,"entityEnglishId":"Poet","startingPos":2,"endingPos":6,"wikidataId":"Q49757"},{"id":1,"type":["Disease"],"matchingTokens":[4],"entityId":"Autism","freebaseTypes":["/fictional_universe/medical_condition_in_fiction","/film/film_subject","/medicine/icd_9_cm_classification","/book/book_subject","/education/field_of_study","/organization/organization_sector","/tv/tv_subject","/medicine/disease"],"confidenceScore":7.794,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism","matchedText":"autism","freebaseId":"/m/0gwj","relevanceScore":0.4536,"entityEnglishId":"Autism","startingPos":15,"endingPos":21,"wikidataId":"Q38404"},{"id":2,"type":["Disease"],"matchingTokens":[21],"entityId":"Autism","freebaseTypes":["/fictional_universe/medical_condition_in_fiction","/film/film_subject","/medicine/icd_9_cm_classification","/book/book_subject","/education/field_of_study","/organization/organization_sector","/tv/tv_subject","/medicine/disease"],"confidenceScore":8.651,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism","matchedText":"Autism","freebaseId":"/m/0gwj","relevanceScore":0.4536,"entityEnglishId":"Autism","startingPos":99,"endingPos":105,"wikidataId":"Q38404"},{"id":3,"matchingTokens":[27],"entityId":"Extraversion

her birthday nature walk was a one-time-only thing. “I know Mom’s pretty excited, but if she thinks we’re going to do this sort of thing again, she’s sorely mistaken,” said Calverton’s 16-year-old son, Garrett, who explained that he, his sister, and his father had only agreed to the outing because his mother was turning 50, adding that she had better not get her hopes up and start believing this might become a regular activity. “If she wants to come back by herself and walk along the other trails, that’s up to her. She just needs to know that today is a special occasion, and after this, we’re all done as far as family walks go. This is it.” Garrett Calverton went on to say that while he was willing to walk the whole trail without complaint, if his mother thought she could stop every 10 minutes to read each new sign explaining the area’s native plants and animals, then she had another thing coming.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[12],"entityId":"Wilderness","freebaseTypes":["/media_common/quotation_subject","/book/book_subject"],"confidenceScore":1.011,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness","matchedText":"wilderness","freebaseId":"/m/023bbt","relevanceScore":0.2325,"entityEnglishId":"Wilderness","startingPos":54,"endingPos":64,"wikidataId":"Q911871"},{"id":1,"matchingTokens":[13],"entityId":"Trail","confidenceScore":0.9501,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail","matchedText":"trail","freebaseId":"/m/0hm03","relevanceScore":0.1601,"entityEnglishId":"Trail","startingPos":65,"endingPos":70,"wikidataId":"Q628179"},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[17,18],"entityId":"State

27-year-old reportedly thought to herself as she lay facedown on the massage table, repeatedly second-guessing whether or not she was breathing too loudly while also feeling deeply self-conscious about her unshaven legs. “Maybe I should make a sighing noise to let the masseuse know she’s doing a good job, unless that would seem condescending. God, this is really stressing me out.” When asked by the massage therapist if the pressure being applied to her back felt good, Leigh reportedly nodded vigorously and said that the crushing pain she felt all down her spine was

leadership","body":"Suzanne Evans and Paul Nuttall have announced they are to run for the leadership of UKIP, with both promising to unite the troubled party.\nMs Evans said she would make the party less \"toxic\" and aim to occupy the \"common sense centre\" ground.\nMr Nuttall, like Ms Evans an ex-party chairman, said he was the man to \"bring the factions together\".\nHowever, interim leader Nigel Farage, speaking about Ms Evans, said: \"I won't be voting for her.\"\nThe party has been in turmoil since the referendum in June, when the UK voted to leave the EU.\nMr Farage stood down as leader at the start of July saying he had achieved his political ambition. His successor Diane James resigned earlier this month after only 18 days in the job - leading to Mr Farage's return as interim leader.\nLast week, Steven Woolfe, who had been one of the front-runners to replace Ms James, quit the party a few days after being involved in an altercation with fellow MEP Mike Hookem.\nMs Evans told \nthe BBC's Andrew Marr show\n that she hoped to \"pour oil on troubled water\" after there had been \"a bit too much testosterone\" in UKIP.\nShe said focusing on the centre ground meant \"not the wishy washy Lib Dem centre\" but a party capable of taking votes from both left and right.\nShe also accused leadership rival Raheem Kassam of seeking to take the party too far to the right and added: \"Our 2015 general election manifesto took the best of politics from the left and from the right\".\nAnalysis \nBy Political Correspondent Alan Soady\nPaul Nuttall described himself as the \"unity candidate\". Yet today's skirmishes show how much UKIP is riven by feuding factions. \nThis leadership contest is about much more than choosing an individual. \nIt's about deciding the future of a party which has been dominated for so long by Nigel Farage and focussed for years on getting - and winning - an EU referendum. \nWhile the next leader will want to make sure the government delivers the kind of Brexit UKIP wants, there are longer-term existential questions.\nThese are: how the party stays relevant, what positions it takes on all sorts of other policy areas, and where it places itself on the political spectrum. \nSo far, the signs are the battle for the future could be a bloody one.\nHowever, Mr Farage, speaking on ITV's Peston on Sunday, said she would not be receiving his vote, adding: \"I don't doubt she has ability, it's just a question of political direction and to kick off her campaign decrying one of the declared candidates is not what we needed.\"\nHe also dismissed Ms Evans' views that the party should be in the centre ground, saying: \"UKIP is a radical political party that pushes for change and needs to go on being a radical political party.\"\nMr Kassam responded to Ms Evans' accusation \non Twitter, saying:\n \"It is sad that 60 seconds after she launched her campaign on the BBC, Suzanne Evans attacked me and my thousands of supporters as 'far right'.\"\nIn a fuller email sent to Ms Evans, he added: \"I would hereby request that you cease referring to vast swatches of UKIP as 'far right' and embark upon a positive campaign, structured upon not who you are against, but what you are for.\"\nSpeaking to Dermot Murnaghan on Sky News, Mr Kassam also said he wanted to unite the party and added: \"I think now, especially after that incident with Steven Woolfe in the European Parliament, we have to say this has gone too far. \n\"We are all in the same party and if we wish to remain in the same party let's sit down around a table together.\" \nNominations in the current leadership election close on 31 October, with the eventual winner announced on 28 November. \nMr Nuttall said that he had decided to stand for the leadership after the troubles of the past few months, telling Andrew Neil on \nthe BBC's Sunday Politics:\n \"UKIP needs to come together. At the moment it is looking over the edge of a political cliff and it will either step off or step back. I want to be the candidate who will tell us to come backwards.\"\nExplaining why, when he didn't stand for the leadership earlier in the year, Mr Nuttall said: \"I felt that with Brexit that my job and Nigel's job was done and we could hand over to the next generation.\n\"But that doesn't appear to have been the case and maybe it's time for someone who's an older hand in many ways.\"\nHe added: \"We need a strong UKIP there in the background to ensure that Brexit means Brexit and I believe that UKIP can become the patriotic face of working people.\"\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Person","OfficeHolder"],"matchingTokens":[0,1],"entityId":"Suzanne

explain to several ISIS militants what BuzzFeed News is. “So, it’s part of a broader digital media network, and it started out as a spinoff from our entertainment content because that made more sense from an advertising perspective, but now it’s a separate news vertical of its own—it reports on stuff like any other news site, I swear,” said a frightened Cascella, who only seemed to perplex and anger his interrogators further when, after being asked to state his background, he mentioned that he got his start writing listicles for the website before eventually moving up to report on actual real-world events. “No, I don’t have a physical copy; it’s only online. We’re sort of like Huffington Post, if you’re familiar with that, but for a younger audience. Maybe you’ve done one of our quizzes? They’re very popular. If you just go to BuzzFeed.com—and try not to look at the homepage—then just click on ‘News,’ which is the first tab, it will bring you to actual news stories.

leading banks set to pull out of UK early next year\n","body":"Britain’s biggest banks are preparing to relocate out of the UK in the first few months of 2017 amid growing fears over the impending Brexit negotiations, while smaller banks are making plans to get out before Christmas.\nThe dramatic claim is \nmade in the \n by the chief executive of the \nBritish Bankers’ Association\n, Anthony Browne, who warns “the public and political debate at the moment is taking us in the wrong direction”.\nA source close to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, said he and the chancellor, \nPhilip Hammond\n, had last week sought to offer reassurance that they were determined to secure the status of the City of London.\nHowever, the government’s stated intention to take control of the freedom of movement into the UK is widely recognised among officials to be a hammer blow to any chance of retaining the present terms of trade for banks, particularly given the bellicose rhetoric of major politicians on the continent.\nThe so-called \npassporting rights\n for members of the single market allow UK-based banks to offer financial services to companies and individuals across the EU unimpeded, yet the French president, François Hollande, is among those who have insisted in recent weeks that hard Brexit \nwill mean “hard negotiation”\n and Britain will need to “pay the price” of leaving.\nA hard Brexit would involve the UK leaving both the single market, a central pillar of which is freedom of movement, and the customs union, which could potentially reintroduce tariff and non-tariff restrictions on British imports and exports.\nBrowne warns that British and European politicians who appear to be pursuing “anti-trade” goals need to recognise that “putting up barriers to the trade in financial services across the Channel will make us all worse off”.\nBrowne, whose organisation has been in intense negotiations with the government, further warns the EU that banks based in the UK are currently lending £1.1tn, therefore “keeping the continent afloat financially”, and this arrangement is at risk.\nOf Britain’s position, he writes that banking is the country’s biggest export industry by far and the current trajectory threatens not just tariff-free trade, but the legal right of banks to provide services.\n“Most international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers, the date by which this must happen, and how best to do it,” he says.\n“Their hands are quivering over the relocate button. Many smaller banks plan to start relocations before Christmas; bigger banks are expected to start in the first quarter of next year.”\nSources close to Davis dismissed speculation that he believed a solution would be for the City to strike an “equivalence” deal with the EU, under which the regulatory systems are recognised by both parties through a one-off agreement. Browne writes that some Brexiters have made such an argument, but such a deal would not be enough to stop banks deserting Britain.\n“On this side of the Channel, some high-profile Brexiters have poured scorn on the idea that we need passporting at all and that other regimes such as ‘third country equivalence’ will do,” he says.\n“But the EU’s equivalence regime is a poor shadow of passporting – it only covers a narrow range of services, can be withdrawn at virtually no notice, and will probably mean the UK will have to accept rules it has no influence over. For most banks, equivalence won’t prevent them from relocating their operations.”\nIt has been reported that Goldman Sachs is among those drawing up plans to transfer around 2,000 of its employees to a rival European city, should the UK lose its passporting rights.\nThe industry body \nTheCityUk\n has claimed that up to 70,000 financial jobs could be lost if Britain leaves the EU without a new, credible relationship in place for the City of London.\nBrowne says he understands the motivation of those who are seeking to take business from UK shores, but he condemns politicians who appear to be willing to break up the integrated financial market, which “makes it easier and cheaper for French farmers, German manufacturers and Italian fashion designers to secure funding”.\nHe writes: “It is understandable that other European cities want to attract jobs from London. Delegations from Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Madrid are all coming to the UK to pitch to bankers. I am pro-competition, and long may they try to make their labour market and fiscal policy more attractive to international investors.\n“That is not the problem. The problem comes when national governments try to use the EU exit negotiations to build walls across the Channel to split Europe’s integrated financial market in two, in order to force jobs from London.”\nThe scale of the task facing the UK in striking a good Brexit deal with the EU has been put in stark relief by the apparent collapse of the proposed EU-Canada trade pact.\nOn Saturday, there were frantic diplomatic efforts to salvage a deal after Canada’s international trade minister, Chrystia Freeland, \nwalked out of talks\n. She described the situation as “impossible” on Friday and cast doubt on the bloc’s ability to operate effectively after the proposals were blocked by a regional administration in Belgium.\nThe parliament in Wallonia is \nholding up the deal\n, although the region’s leader, Paul Magnette, suggested the standoff could be resolved within days. It has concerns the deal will undermine labour, environment and consumer standards, and allow multinationals to crush local firms.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Country"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"United

Ford: ‘I wore a suit on set. It's a uniform… I feel weak in trainers’\n","body":"\ns I enter the hotel suite, \nTom Ford\n stands in silhouette against an industrial, ceiling-height window, the light refracted behind him in a sunburst. It’s an irresistible image, so perfect it almost had to be composed: both man and room shown off to their optimal effect. And, who am I kidding, it probably was. I had been checked at the door for a minute or two while Ford had rearranged some furniture that was irking him. Even a rented room, used for a day to plug a new movie, can be improved. Ford is obsessed with beautiful things and has had an enduring and hugely successful career, first in fashion, now as a film director, making people and places look their best.\nFord strides towards me, eager, like a politician on the election trail, and extends his hand. I had read that he prefers to be called “Mr Ford” and check if that’s the case. “No, no, no,” he smiles, as if it was one of the top five most ridiculous things he’s ever heard. “Pleeease call me Tom.”\nTom Ford, the man, has always been the most compelling advertisement for Tom Ford, the creative output. He is, it’s almost inane to note, a very handsome individual. These are looks that many would sell their souls for, but Ford, now an impossible 55 years old, hasn’t needed to: just lots of vegetables and fish, no booze for years, tennis three times a week and an occasional restrained touch-up with Botox under the eyes and Just for Men dye on his beard stubble.\nToday, as he almost always does, Ford wears a cinched black suit, matching tie, a gold collar bar. “A suit is armour,” he explains. “You know, I’m not good in knitwear.” His voice, almost a growl, is saturated with disdain. “I feel mushy and soft. I’m not good in anything but a boot. I feel solid and grounded. You gotta learn in life what makes you feel comfortable in terms of clothing and that’s what you should wear. Some people look great in knitwear; that’s what they want to wear, they look good in it, it feels right for them. Trainers: I feel weak in trainers. I mean, I wear them when I’m at the gym, but I feel soft and I don’t like that.”\nI actually had people say to me, ‘My God, I didn’t realise you had such depth.’ It’s kind of shocking\nHow about when he was shooting his new film, \n\n, did Ford wear a suit then? “Yes, I wore it on set, it’s a uniform. I’m comfortable, it suits who I am,” he replies. “Except the parts when we were in Texas, where I wore cowboy boots and a cowboy hat, which looks surprisingly good on me. Well, all of a sudden, 200 years of Texas pioneer background kind of genetically seems to just work on my head. And I don’t look like a fool.”\nFord – I hope this is coming across – is surprisingly funny. He is completely serious and at the same time, nullifying the criticism often levelled at those in the fashion world, completely aware that some people will find what he’s saying ridiculous. There are numerous stories-cum-urban-legends that have attached themselves to Ford over the years. That he takes five baths a day. That he doesn’t like to see or smell food in his office. That he once sent an employee home for wearing three-quarter-length trousers. That he cannot abide hot drinks. That – this one courtesy of Victoria Beckham – he flies long haul in his suit and his only concession is to undo a single waistcoat button.\nSome people would regard him as eccentric, I say. “Eccentric?” says Ford, visibly perking up, his hands carving arcs, like a matador’s. “Oh, tell me about that!”\nThe multiple baths in a day. “Oh, I can explain that,” he counters, a little disappointed perhaps that the rumour was not more outrageous. “For me, it’s meditation. I take a bath in the morning, because the time I lie in the bathtub is when I work out all my problems. I think about the day, I think about what I’ve got to do. I think about nothing, I clear my head. Same in the evening, before dinner, I can’t go from work and out to a dinner and be good at a dinner – meaning be interesting and charming and be interested and listen to someone – unless I kind of wash away the day. The same at night, I can’t go to sleep unless I get in the bathtub and again, wash away the day. So it’s meditative for me, it’s not that I have some cleanliness obsession.”\nSo that’s cleared that up. “I don’t smoke,” he goes on. “Some people go out and have a cigarette. I don’t drink, some people drink.” He exhales theatrically. “I lie in a bath full of hot water.”\nIt is common, as shown here, to fixate on Ford’s aesthetic. This is, after all, how he made his name: he arrived, unheralded, as a designer at \nGucci\n in 1990, when the company was on its knees; when he departed in 2004, it was one of the world’s most desired luxury brands, owning Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, and valued at $10bn. In 2006, he started trading under his own name and there are now 122 Tom Ford stores, which take around $1bn each year in sales. Daniel Craig insists on Tom Ford suits for the Bond films, while Michelle Obama chose one of his gowns when she met the Queen.\nThe idea, though, that he might be stronger on style than substance endured when Ford moved into film. His first feature, in 2010, was \n\n, which followed a day in the life of a college professor, masterfully played by Colin Firth, who is contemplating suicide. It was a deeply assured debut and one that Ford was involved in every aspect of: as a writer – adapting \nChristopher Isherwood’s 1964 novel\n – director and producer, plunging in some of his own savings, not all of which were returned at the box office. Still, many reviewers struggled to see past the lush cinematography and Firth’s instantly iconic thick-rimmed spectacles. Peter Bradshaw in the \nGuardian\n wrote that it sometimes resembled \n“a 100-minute commercial for men’s cologne: Bereavement by Dior”\n.\nFord believes, with some justification, that there is a perception of him as an individual that precedes his films. “I’m a very, very, very private person,” he says. “I’m also a very shy person. So what most people know of me is a product. It is a billboard. It is a selling tool. That’s not to say it’s false. It comes from me. Everything I make I am proud of. So this is a part of my personality, but it’s the surface. When I made \nA Single Man\n, I actually had people say to me, ‘My God, I didn’t realise you had such depth.’ It’s kind of shocking. You realise, ‘Oh, oh-kay…’”\nHis point is that the real Ford is more than the guy with perma-stubble who happens to look fantastic in aviators. “I’m glad that there is a large part of my character and my personality that is private,” he says. “You know, I don’t have a personal Instagram account, I’m not photographing my dinner every night and sending it out to the world. I’m quite private and the older I get the more I guard that, and the more famous I’ve become, the more and more and more I guard that.”\nIt’s not just reviewers, either. When Ford approached Jake Gyllenhaal to star in \nNocturnal Animals\n, the actor has admitted that he was concerned Ford, whom he didn’t know at this point, would \n“focus on the aesthetic over the heart of the story”\n. Gyllenhaal, however, was quickly convinced after speaking to the director, as was Amy Adams, who signed on to play the female lead, Susan, a privileged but unhappy gallery owner.\nMy son is going to grow up in a very privileged world, and I want to make sure that he’s grounded\n“I have to say, luckily most of the reviews of \nNocturnal Animals\n have been terrific,” notes Ford. “But the very few criticisms have been that’s it’s too beautiful, too stylised. I think if I didn’t have another life as a fashion designer I wouldn’t be hearing that and people wouldn’t be judging that.\n“Not comparing myself to Hitchcock,” he continues, “but I’ll use him as an example. He was notorious for spending weeks on his leading ladies’ hair, makeup, look, clothes. What most directors do is intentional: how they frame something, whether it’s composed or not composed is part of telling the story. In this particular case, that very hard, lacquered, manufactured, glamorous life is part of the story. It’s key to understanding who Susan is and how she lives. It isn’t just random because I wanted to see some beautiful clothes and beautiful hair and beautiful makeup. This is part of the story.”\nThat story is something of a departure for Ford, as well. \nNocturnal Animals \n – a Grand Jury prize winner at Venice – which is adapted, again by Ford, from a 1993 novel called \n\n by Austin Wright, begins as very much a companion piece to \nA Single Man\n. Susan lives in a striking modernist house straight from the pages of \nWallpaper*\n; her husband, Hutton (Armie Hammer), seems to smell of money, but they clearly don’t much like each other. Susan has even inherited Colin Firth’s signature glasses.\nEverything changes, though, when Susan receives a package from her first husband, Edward (Gyllenhaal), whom she hasn’t seen in years: it’s a novel he’s written, dedicated to her; a brutal page-turner about a family travelling across the Texas desert who find themselves in an altercation with a gang of young droogs. \nNocturnal Animals\n now starts flicking between Susan’s sedate, joyless life in Los Angeles and a pulse-racing crime thriller that plays out in her head as she reads Edward’s book. Ford ultimately intertwines these stories into one suffocatingly intense narrative and makes powerful, sometimes stinging comments on the importance of loyalty, the thrill of revenge and the perils of consumerism.\nYes, you read that straight: Tom Ford is railing against the perils of consumerism. A man whose eponymous fashion label sells an oversize Dakota bag for $6,450 (£5,250) and whose suits for men all cost in excess of $5,000 (£4,100). A man who owns a house in Bel Air designed by Richard Neutra, an 1827 John Nash Mayfair townhouse and a ranch in New Mexico, on land larger than Manhattan, with Tadao Ando buildings and an airstrip, which was recently put on the market for £60m. But Ford is no fool and well aware of the extreme potential for hypocrisy.\n“The character of Susan is quite autobiographical; in some ways, she was a female version of me,” Ford admits. “Fortunate or not, I live in that world that Susan lives in. I know those people. A few years ago now, I really had a midlife crisis. I think a lot of my younger years – and a lot of people’s younger years, I bet – are spent achieving whatever it is, when you’re young, you think you need to do. Getting ahead in your career, getting this, getting that, buying your first apartment, getting married and then you realise, ‘OK, well I’ve done all that, now what? Is this what there is?’”\nA low point came when he acrimoniously left Gucci: his drinking got out of control, he became depressed. “A lot of people keep it in check. I didn’t. That doesn’t mean you want to give up those material things, but it means you need to keep a balance and so yeah, I’ve struggled with that. And I’ve struggled with contemporary culture. Sometimes, contemporary culture revolts me. And where we’re moving, it just disgusts me.”\nFord shakes his head. He’s aware he’s asking questions and not supplying too many answers. “We’re culturally taught now that there’s this thing called happiness that’s achievable,” he sighs. Where we’re just happy because we’ve done this and that, we’ve gotten there, we’ve bought this house and we’ve got these kids and we’re just happy now. That’s a relatively new idea. Because happiness doesn’t exist. A happy morning exists and then maybe a depressing lunch and a bad afternoon and maybe a nice evening. We’re sold this concept and I realise that I’m one of the people that’s helping do this because I’m responsible also for our contemporary consumer culture.”\nFord grew up middle class in middle America, first in Texas, then New Mexico from the age of 11; his parents were real-estate agents. From as early as he can remember, Ford had a singular fascination with style. He often chose to wear a suit as a child and was mercilessly bullied at school for carrying a briefcase. “Actually, it was an attache case,” he corrects. “But that’s true, they were really mean to me. I look back at pictures of myself in a little raincoat and briefcase and I just think, ‘Oh God…’ But that was me and my parents just let me express who I was, which was also great.”\nAgain you get the impression, though he might deny it, that Ford has never been bothered by being regarded as eccentric. “I have a sister, she didn’t dress like that at all,” he says. “She’s not remotely interested in fashion, she’s an English teacher. She could have all the Tom Ford clothes she wants; she doesn’t care. She’s quite beautiful but she’s never been into fashion. My mother is, however, and my grandmother was to the nth degree. So I had women around me who were. I don’t think I ever saw my mother without her makeup as a child. Ever. But that’s a very Texas thing. My first scent memories were hairspray – it was the early 1960s, I was sitting on the floor playing while she was getting dressed.”\nFord has been reflecting on his early years more since he’s become a parent himself. Jack was born four years ago, reportedly by in-vitro fertilisation and a surrogate, to Ford and Richard Buckley, a fashion writer and his partner of 30 years. “He’s going to grow up in a very privileged world and I want to make sure that he’s grounded,” says Ford, who, after 25 years living in Europe, mainly London, recently moved his primary residence to Los Angeles (“All of a sudden I needed some sun. I did!”). “So a big consideration is to try to raise him in a very natural, non-elitist way.”\nJack’s arrival, Ford believes, has made him perhaps a fraction less uptight; he’d hoped that Jack would play with tasteful, grey wooden toys, but his stark, beautiful houses are now defiled by lurid plastic. “At the end of the day, he always tells me about his day and I tell him about my day and Richard talks about his day,” says Ford. “The other night, Jack says, ‘Well, how was your day? You look sad.’ And I said, ‘Well, it was a tough day.’ Then he said, ‘You know, you say that every night.’ And I said, ‘I do?’ And he said, ‘Yeah. So what are you going to do about that?’\n“And I thought, ‘Wow, what am I going to do about that?’ Their observations are so simple and so clear: ‘Well, you’re sad, you need to do something about that.’ It’s very interesting. Then I felt guilty and terrible: ‘Oh God, I’m going home every day and seeming sad and I should be really there for him.’ But you know, just the daily stresses of businesses sometimes get to you.”\nFilms make Ford happy, he insists, but he still retains a stubborn streak of melancholy. “Working, for me, keeps me distracted and keeps me from pondering the ultimate end to all of this, which is the same for all of us,” he says. “We have to let go of it all, we have to say goodbye to everything. That doesn’t terrify me, but I’m aware of it every second. And I think it’s one of the things that makes me appreciate things, because you realise this isn’t going to last, so I need to look at it, I need to experience it, I need to try to drink it in. Beauty I find so sad. There’s nothing sadder to me than true, true beauty because it is so temporary and so transient, so somehow you’ve got to embrace that aspect of it.\n“I don’t know,” he concludes, “I sound like a crazy person. I guess I’m quite philosophical and I spend an enormous amount of time pondering all of these things – in the bath. In the bath!”\nSeeing as much of modern culture, as he says, “disgusts” him, does Ford ever worry about the world that Jack will grow up in? “I think every generation feels that,” he replies. “You go back and read something 100 years old and that’s what adults are talking about. For them, it will be their world. And some day Kim Kardashian is probably going to be on some stage at Kennedy Center Honors [annual awards given to a handful of artists judged to have made a meaningful contribution to American culture] when she’s 80, getting an award.” Ford claps, perhaps sarcastically. “And everyone’s going to say, ‘Oh my God, Kim Kardashian, don’t you remember when she was…’” She will be their Marilyn. She will be there because this is the world we live in.”\nIt’s been seven years since \nA Single Man\n, but Ford has been keeping busy. He wanted to devote proper time to raising his son. Meanwhile, the fashion juggernaut rolls on, requiring a new collection for men and women twice a year. There were false starts, too, before he settled on \nNocturnal Animals\n as the script to pursue. “There’s been work. Thought. And things I turned down.” He laughs. “And two screenplays I wrote that are not so good and I wouldn’t make.”\nFord continues to love clothes and he’s proud of the enduring popularity of Tom Ford, but it’s hard not to feel that he has little left to prove in that world. He pretty well admits as much. “There’s a moment in fashion when you think of the idea,” he says. “You think, ‘Oh God, fuck, that’s it!’ And a lot of times you’re wrong and it doesn’t work at all, but that moment when you think it does is great. But fashion is very fleeting. You can look at that same thing the next year and you’re like, ‘OK, yeah that’s nice.’ And you look at it years later in a museum and you go, ‘Well, that’s interesting, look at how I did that stitching, that was great.’ But it never has the power that it does at the very beginning.\n“And film does,” he continues. “You watch an old film, everyone’s dead but you’re crying with them, you’re emoting with them; it’s the most rewarding thing if you’re someone who wants to express themselves. It’s the most permanent thing I think that we have. Even painting. Let’s take abstract expressionism. The very first time people saw an abstract painting it would have been shocking. Today, it’s modern vocabulary, we see it everywhere, it can’t have the [same] power. Film doesn’t do that. Film, if it’s not something that’s easily dated, if it’s genuine, has the same power when you watch it 30 years, 40 years, 80 years later. It’s not diluted. And that’s incredible.”\nThere’s a stubborn sniffiness about a fashion designer making films, but the process is remarkably similar, Ford has found. Both require a strong vision, something to say and the ability to command an army of hired hands, working them hard without demoralising them, inspiring them to bring to life what you have in your head. Both activities also suit an obsessive, single-minded temperament. It’s easy to mock the idea of Ford luxuriating in three baths a day, but he wakes at 4.30am, barely sleeps and can subsist for days on just iced coffee and Oreo Thins.\nFord has also brought a mastery of the eye-catching stunt to both fields, often involving nudity. One advertisement for Gucci, shot by Mario Testino, featuring a female model pulling down her pants to show a G shaved in her pubic hair. Sophie Dahl sprawled libidinously on a silk sheet for Opium by Yves Saint Laurent, meanwhile, found its way on to the Advertising Standards Agency’s \n“Top 10 Most Complained About Ads”\n list. Ford, though, has always considered himself \n“an equal-opportunity objectifier”\n and in 2002 he showed a male martial artist full frontal in an ad for YSL’s M7 fragrance.\nThe opening scenes of \nNocturnal Animals\n have been causing a similar fuss at film festivals. It depicts a montage of full-figured, not-young women dancing naked in slow motion. They are accessorised with bits and pieces of Americana while glitter tumbles around them. Eventually, the viewer clicks that it is in fact a video art piece that is being projected in Susan’s gallery. So Tom Ford, what were you…\n“What were you thinking?” he interjects. “What the hell was that?”\nExactly. “When I was young I had a poster of Farrah Fawcett in a red bikini, which I’m sure you’ve seen, with the big teeth and hair, and I think that was a lot of people’s idea of America: the land of tans, beauty and youth,” Ford explains. “And I decided that today, perhaps, to the outside world America looks gluttonous, overfed, ageing, sagging, decrepit. So I shot that and I had the most fun day making that. These women were so happy to be there, they were so free, they were just liberated, they were spectacular. I fell in love with them. And I realised that actually they were the opposite of Susan: they were joyful because they had let go of what they were supposed to be and they were just themselves. Whether you like them or hate them and think they are fat or not fat, they were themselves. And they were comfortable with that. So that became the opening art sequence.”\nFord has clearly thought about his defence, marshalled his arguments, but he can’t help a mischievous aside. “From a practical standpoint and a theatrical standpoint, it also pulls you right into the film from the beginning,” he says. “Gets your attention and that’s important. And then you’re like, ‘Where’s this going?’ And you’re watching.”\nNocturnal Animals\n is likely to surprise many people: it is smarter, more visceral, more thought-provoking than doubters would have expected from Tom Ford, while still being just as beguiling to look at. He draws compelling, award-worthy performances from Amy Adams, \nJake Gyllenhaal\n and Michael Shannon, as a nihilistic Texas policeman charged with tracking down the thugs. It is a terrific film that stirs and aggressively challenges the head, eyes and heart.\nFord vows that it won’t be seven years before he has a new movie project; he’ll never be prolific, partly because he wants to be involved in every stage of the process, but three years is more like it. What about children, would he like more? “Originally, I thought yes; however now I think no,” he says. “I love Jack, we’re a great family, we’re very happy, the three of us. I’m not a young dad, Richard’s an even older dad. If I pick Jack up out of the bathtub and he wiggles the wrong way, it throws my back out. I think there’s a reason why people have children when they’re in their 20s and 30s! So no, we’re really happy as a family as we are.”\nThis is perhaps the most shocking moment of the interview: Ford, a man who seems personally to defy the progress of time, acknowledges that he is getting older. As we wrap up our conversation, I ask him if he’s just a bit terrified about ageing. “I think it’s time I started ageing, otherwise I’ll start looking odd,” he says. “You have to give in to it. I mind the physical part that comes with it, but the actual mindset that comes with it, I love. Because while I don’t like it, I also don’t care as much. So what? This is who I am.”\nWhat about letting himself go grey? He looks at me sternly, then a little hurt. “What makes you think I’m grey?!” Then his voice rumbles like a muscle car revving its engine: “Oh no, I’ve planned on going grey. I know exactly when I’ll go grey. I have a four‑year-old child, there’s lots of time to go grey. I plan on living into my 90s, so maybe 72, 73, 74, I’ll go grey. Then I’ll have a good 20 years of grey.” A stickler for good manners, he walks me to the door of the suite. “That’s plenty.”\nNocturnal Animals is out on 4

explosions have hit the Japanese city of Utsunomiya, killing one person and injuring three others in what police are viewing as a possible suicide.\n Japanese media reports suggest that the victim, believed to be a 72-year-old former military officer, may have set his house on fire, blown up his car in a public car park and then blown himself up in a nearby park.\n A note found in the clothing of the badly burnt victim included the name of the former officer, the Japanese broadcaster NHK and other media reported. The name was not disclosed. One of the cars destroyed in a blaze in the car park belonged to the retired military man, and his house burned to the ground earlier on Sunday, the reports said.\n The back-to-back loud bangs in the park and parking lot shocked bystanders, many heading to a festival at the park on a sunny autumn day. The apparent blasts occurred at around 11.30am within about 200 metres of each other. The festival was cancelled after the incidents.\n Two men were seriously injured in the park explosion, and a 14-year-old boy had minor leg injuries. No one was hurt at the small car park.\nThe agency Kyodo News said the burnt body was found after police received a call saying a person was on fire following what sounded like an explosion.\n Bystanders also reported hearing loud blasts from the car park. Flames and black smoke shot into the air and repeated bangs could be heard on video posted on the Asahi newspaper’s website. Nearby cars also were damaged.\n Utsunomiya, the capital of Tochigi prefecture, is a city of about 500,000 people about 60 miles (100km) north of Tokyo. It is near the popular tourist destination of Nikko.\n","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Country"],"matchingTokens":[6],"entityId":"Empire of

universally acknowledged that school photos are bad – really bad. So in today’s modern world of selfies and filters, it’s not surprising that a firm now \noffers to airbrush away imperfections and blemishes\n from these pictures. But would you retouch your mantlepiece marvels? We asked our readers to share with us their old school photos, and tell us what they mean to them now.\nI must have been around seven or eight when this photo was taken. I dreaded getting it done because a couple of weeks earlier I’d cut my own hair for some reason. I’d woken up in the middle of the night and noticed it was sticking up. Instead of going back to bed, I got out some bathroom scissors and – not even with the lights on – cut off the part of my hair that was out of place. I woke up the next morning and there was a huge gaping square block in the middle of my fringe. My mum sent me to the hairdressers to try and fix it (unsuccessfully) which is why there’s a ridiculous peak towards the middle of my fringe. \nThis photo reminds me of what it was like growing up and even the mindset I had at that time. As cliched as it might sound, I think of it as simpler, easier times when nothing was really important – except acne and not farting in front of the girl you liked in drama class (it happened). I was self-conscious then but not to the stage of wanting to airbrush a photo, it’s nice to look back on it with all the imperfections (many of which have now morphed into fully fledged defects).\nIn this photo my friend Will, on the right, and I were both around 15. One day we were walking down our school corridor and saw a queue of siblings lined up waiting to go into the school hall to get their photo taken. Will nipped off to the toilet to put his hair in pigtails , and we slipped into the queue and had our picture taken. Of course, we later got called to the deputy head’s office who would not entertain our claim that we were cousins and received our punishment. \nIn September this year Will got married, and the photo turned up as part of the best man’s speech given by his brother. This is the only school photo I still have a copy of, and it’s the only one my mum still has framed in her lounge. It’s possible that she’s never been more proud of me. Unlike most other school photos, this really caught my character at the time. It reminds me of the fun I used to have.\nI was five and it was the first time I had a photo taken on my own, soon afterwards my brother started at the same school and we had to have a joint photo. It was taken in the school library. I can remember a teacher brushing my hair before the photo. I felt it was a very intimate thing to do, at that age only my mum had done that before. \nI remember I wasn’t enjoying school very much. I was a summer baby and started at Christmas when everyone else had already made friends, and was very shy. I was also mercilessly bullied by a group of girls because they had long hair and my mum made me keep mine short. She thought it was chic and French-looking, but I just wanted to be like everyone else. The girls I was bullied by were very girly and targeted me.\nThis photo means a lot to me: it’s full of memories. I am wearing my favourite dress, which my mum made for me, and a brooch of a swan which I won at a fair – my first bit of jewellery. I was quite a tomboy, and was often mistaken for a boy, but this was the first time I felt quite feminine. It was a beautiful dress – my mum was very talented with a sewing machine. All the teachers and dinner ladies commented on it, and I felt very special for the first time since I started primary school. Obviously I’ve changed a lot since then, mainly due to life experiences that make you grow up (in my case, the early deaths of my parents). But, if I’m ever at a wedding, or an event when I don’t know anyone, I still feel like the little shy girl with the short hair in the picture. \n\nThis is me aged 11, posing for my year 7 school photograph. When I look at it, it makes me think of Augustus Gloop or Bruce from Matilda: it looks like I was dreaming about chocolate. School wasn’t good or bad for me, it just happened. I was a bit of a double agent: I could hang out with pretty much anyone but never had a true solid pack of friends. I was never particularly good or bad at anything, I just sort of drifted through unnoticed. It was always like that, even when I was in primary school – I vividly remember being sick on the first day I had sandwiches for lunch instead of hot dinners. I was made to sit on the steps leading into the dining hall to finish my food once I felt better. Every single day after that I sat on those steps eating my lunch (of dry crackers) on my own for the rest of primary school – nobody ever told me I could go back to the seats, I think I must’ve been invisible and obviously quite shy.\nThis photo makes me smile because I look completely different. People are always surprised to see pictures of me at that age and I enjoy making them laugh. It’s perfect: that daydreamy gaze, the massive eye-bags, the chubby cheeks, the complete awkward stage of growing up that kids don’t seem to go through nowadays. It’s good to have imperfect childhood photos because we need the comic relief, the proof of the awkward stage that some of us didn’t even know we were going through. I definitely didn’t think I looked bad back then and I love that. \nThis was taken when I was 16. I was rebelling a little as the uniform should have been white shirt and navy jumper. It was 1985 and crimping was all the rage, so I thought crimping my basin cut was a cool thing to do. At the time I thought I looked awful and given the chance would have PhotoShopped my hair. I also thought myself ugly. I’m so glad I didn’t get that opportunity to PhotoShop this image though as I was beautiful but just didn’t know it. I also like the hair, as it represents a time of experimenting with my appearance and trying to be cool and unconventional yet desperate to fit in. \n\nSchool was on my list of least favourite experiences. I had no confidence and felt others were better than me. I left at 16 after failing most of my o’levels. I was bright and intelligent but off the radar as far as the teachers efforts were concerned. The lack of uniform speaks volumes to me. I look at this image with sadness: I wish I could put my arms around the girl in the picture and tell her everything will be fine. I see how beautiful I was now but I was blind to it back then. \nThat was a difficult year for my family and I. We lived in Bermondsey, south-east London, in an area recognised by police and authorities to be rife with racism. As a mixed-race child, I was often the target of verbal and physical abuse , resulting in a childhood spent mostly indoors, reading, writing poetry, playing video games and learning to cook.\nSchool life was similarly onerous. Throughout year 4, our class were taught by a rapidly revolving door of supply teachers, leading to a disjointed curriculum and short, throwaway relationships with teachers. This culminated in my receiving a damning year 5 report and I was ultimately written off by the school after this, expected only to be able to get into sink secondary schools, live on sink estates, and remain a permanent statistic in the British underclass.\nThat was 20 years ago, and it feels more than strange to look back on it now. In the last two decades I have passed my driving test, bought a flat in London, achieved a 2:1 in History from Royal Holloway, and played gigs with my favourite bands. I have begun to accumulate the lines and wrinkles that come with age, alongside the resultant scars from inner-London youth violence. I may not be as fresh-faced as the child in that picture, but I’ll take the ravages of time with the feats I have achieved. Life is better now.

and injuring 31, an NBC affiliate reported.\nThe bus was traveling west on Interstate 10 when the crash occurred near Palm Springs, a city about 100 miles (160 km) east of Los Angeles, the television station reported.\nThe Riverside County Coroner's Office confirmed 13 people aboard the bus were killed, the station said. \nThe National Transportation Safety Board said it will investigate the fatal crash and is sending an investigative team to the crash site.\nPhotographs from the scene showed the front of the tour bus wedged inside the back of the trailer, with emergency workers using metal ladders to reach the inside of the bus. A tow truck was used to separate the vehicles, local media including the Desert Sun newspaper reported. \nThe injured were being treated at local hospitals, while all westbound lanes of the interstate were closed near the crash, according to the reports.\nThe bus had left the Red Earth Casino in Salton City, California, and was headed to Los Angeles when the crash was reported to the California Highway Patrol at 5:17 a.m. (1217 GMT), the NBC affiliate said.\n (Reporting by David Ingram in New York and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Bill Trott and Sandra

to meet Indians in World Series","body":"The Chicago Cubs dispatched the Los Angeles Dodgers with power and pitching on Saturday to win the National League pennant and reach their first World Series in 71 years.\nThe Cubs, for more than half a century viewed as the lovable losers of old ivy-covered Wrigley Field, beat the best pitcher of the now generation in Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw in a 5-0 victory that clinched the National League pennant, 4-2.\nNext up, the Cleveland Indians and the Curse of the Billy Goat.\nThe long-suffering Cubs head to Cleveland on Tuesday to begin a best-of-seven for Major League Baseball's championship    with a chance to end the longest title drought in major North American professional sports -- 108 years -- and erase a fabled curse.\nAnthony Rizzo and Willson Contreras blasted home runs to support the two-hit pitching of Kyle Hendricks and Aroldis Chapman that sent Cubs fans into delirium, rocked the 102-year-old stadium in Chicago and ignited a city-wide celebration.\nTransformed by a new management regime led by team president Theo Epstein, who also helped the Boston Red Sox exorcise the Curse of the Bambino with their first Series win in 86 years, the Cubbies will enter the 112th Fall Classic as favorites after a major league-leading 103 regular season wins.  \nThe Indians had their own history of sporting futility in the city on the southern shore of Lake Erie once nicknamed the “Mistake on the Lake”, going without a World Series title since 1948.\nBut no club touches the ordeal of the Cubs, whose deprived fans have waited four decades longer than their Cleveland counterparts.\nThe Cubs were an early power in the major leagues, winning their second World Series in a row in 1908 in the fifth edition of the Fall Classic.\nThe Cubs remained a strong team over the next few decades but kept falling short in the World Series. They were runners-up in six World Series in the years following when they once again won the National League pennant for another crack at the title in 1945.\nTHE CURSE\nLegend has it that Billy Goat Tavern owner Billy Sianis was asked to leave Game Four of the 1945 Series at Wrigley Field against the Detroit Tigers because the odor of his pet goat, Murphy, was bothering other fans.\nOutraged, Sianis cursed the Cubs on his way out of the World Series game, shouting they would never win another.\nSeventy-one years later, and 108 years in total, the Cubs and their fans are still waiting.\nThese Cubs look well equipped to end the drought.\nBuilt by a combination of shrewd trades, draft choices and heavy spending on the free agent market, the new Cubs have a young, power-hitting team featuring third baseman Kris Bryant, first baseman Rizzo and shortstop Addison Russell.\nThey support a veteran starting rotation anchored by Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester, National League ERA leader Hendricks and John Lackey.\nLed by manager Joe Maddon, brought in last season as the final piece of their championship puzzle, the Cubs went from 101 losses in Epstein's first season in charge in 2012 to one step from baseball heaven.  \n (Reporting by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Andrew

preparing to leave UK over Brexit, says banking body chief executive","body":"LONDON\n Big international banks are preparing to move some of their operations out of Britain in early 2017 due to the uncertainty over the country's future relationship with the European Union,  a top banking official said.\nWriting in the Observer newspaper, Anthony Browne, the chief executive of lobby group the British Bankers' Association, said the public and political debate was \"taking us in the wrong direction\" and businesses could not wait until the last minute.\n\"Most international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers, the date by which this must happen, and how best to do it,\" said Browne.\n\"Their hands are quivering over the relocate button. Many smaller banks plan to start relocations before Christmas; bigger banks are expected to start in the first quarter of next year.\"\nMany of the world's major banks have their European headquarters in Britain, where the financial sector employs more than two million people and makes up almost 12 percent of the economy.\nBanks in London depend on a European \"passport\" to serve clients across the 28-country European Union from one base and lenders worry that this right will end after Brexit.\nBrowne said while finance minister Philip Hammond and Brexit minister David Davis were \"making the right noises\", he was concerned that some high-profile Brexit supporters believed banks did not need passporting and could rely on so-called equivalence, under which the EU can allow access to its markets for countries whose regulations are similar to the bloc's.\n\"The EU's equivalence regime is a poor shadow of passporting, it only covers a narrow range of services, can be withdrawn at virtually no notice, and will probably mean the UK will have to accept rules it has no influence over,\" he said.\n\"For most banks, equivalence won’t prevent them from relocating their operations.\"\nBanks have already said they are making contingency plans to move some of their operations to continental Europe if Britain does not negotiate access to the EU single market after Brexit.\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said she will trigger formal talks to leave the EU by the end of March 2017 after Britain voted to leave in a referendum last June. \nShe has said she will fight to retain access to the single market but several EU leaders have insisted that will depend on Britain accepting free movement of workers from the EU - a condition Britain has vowed to curtail.\n (Reporting by Stephen Addison and Kylie MacLellan; Editing by Grant McCool and Toby

utility PPC (\nDEHr.AT\n) confirmed on Sunday it has received two binding bids for a 24 percent stake in power grid operator ADMIE. \nThe terms of Greece's international bailout require PPC, which is 51 percent state-owned, to either sell its stake in ADMIE or fully privatize the grid by next year. \nPPC said it was examining bids submitted by the Italian power grid Terna (\nTRN.MI\n) jointly with infrastructure fund F2i and by China's State Grid International Development STGRD.UL. \nThe deadline for the submission of bids expired on Friday. An energy ministry source told Reuters on Friday that PPC had received two bids for ADMIE. \nFrench power grid operator RTE, a unit of state-owned utility EDF, (\nEDF.PA\n) which was initially among the short-listed investors, had not made a bid. \nUnder a timetable approved by parliament, a preferred bidder for ADMIE has to be chosen by Oct. 31 and the deal is expected to be concluded in the first three months of 2017.\n (Reporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Ruth
