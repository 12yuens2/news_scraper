[{"title":"Northolt armed stand-off ends as police enter house","body":"A three-day stand-off between armed police and a man feared to have petrol at his home has ended.Officers forced entry to the house in Wood End Lane, Northolt, west London, at about 20:10 BST.A man in his 40s has been arrested on suspicion of offences under the explosives act, cultivation of cannabis and affray.About 80 residents were evacuated from their homes while negotiations with the man took place.The property was searched before neighbours were allowed to start returning home, and police said they were continuing to examine the property.A cordon of 200m had been in place at Wood End Lane since 01:00 BST on Friday, which was extended to 300m on Saturday.The BBC's Catriona Renton said once residents were allowed to return home they had been able to see the property with its windows forced open. She added: \"One woman said, 'We're safe now.' Others said they were just pleased to get home.\"The Met said: \"Police would like to reiterate their thanks to the local community for their support throughout the operation.\"There was a huge amount of disruption to local residents; we are grateful for cooperation we ask for their continued patience as we finish the work at the scene.\"Ch Supt Paul Martin said: \"I am really pleased that this incident has now ended, and importantly ended without anyone coming to harm. \"Our key priority throughout this was to get the man out of the address safely as we had growing concerns about his well-being and believed him to be in crisis.\"After attempts to negotiate over a number of days did not work we used specialist officers to work out how we could gain entry to the address as safely as we could. They did that this evening.\"Scotland Yard said officers from the Territorial Support Group had been supported by the London Fire Brigade as they moved in on the address.Ch Supt Martin said police had also worked closely with the ambulance service and the local authority during the operation.Ealing Council, which had re-housed some affected residents, said it was contacting people to inform them of the outcome.Police had said there was no suggestion the incident was terror-related or linked to any ongoing police operations or investigation.","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["ChemicalSubstance","ChemicalCompound"],"matchingTokens":[12],"entityId":"Gasoline","freebaseTypes":["/engineering/engine_energy_source","/automotive/fuel"],"confidenceScore":1.033,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline","matchedText":"petrol","freebaseId":"/m/05wy2","relevanceScore":0.1456,"entityEnglishId":"Gasoline","startingPos":68,"endingPos":74,"wikidataId":"Q39558"},{"id":1,"matchingTokens":[4,5],"entityId":"Police","freebaseTypes":["/fictional_universe/fictional_organization_type","/film/film_subject","/interests/collection_category","/organization/organization_sector","/book/book_subject","/tv/tv_genre","/media_common/quotation_subject","/organization/organization_type","/media_common/media_genre","/film/film_genre"],"confidenceScore":1.041,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police","matchedText":"armed

Jimmy Perry","body":"Jimmy Perry was best known as the creator of Dad's Army, one of television's most popular, and long running sitcoms.His 25-year partnership with David Croft also produced It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi and You Rang M'Lord?Much of his writing was based on his own varied work experiences which included a spell as a Butlin's Redcoat.He also had an encyclopaedic knowledge of music hall, something he used to good effect when he presented the BBC series Turns, which chronicled variety performances from the 1930s and 40s.Jimmy Perry was born on 20 September 1923 in Barnes, south-west London.His fascination for the world of showbusiness came at an early age and, while still at school, he had his sights set on becoming a stand up-comedian.When war broke out in 1939 he was too young for the army so he signed up in his local Home Guard.It was an experience on which he would later draw when he conceived Dad's Army, basing many of the characters on soldiers he met in the ranks.He was called up in 1941 and sent to Burma where he became part of a Royal Artillery Concert Party, set up to entertain the troops.After the war he began training as an actor at Rada, subsidising his studies with spells as a Redcoat at Butlin's holiday camps.For many years Perry ran the Palace Theatre at Watford as part of a small repertory company that produced a different show each week.Among the aspiring performers who appeared there was Ruth Llewellyn who would later become Ruth Madoc, the indomitable Gladys Pugh in Hi-de-Hi..In the early 1960s he was playing a series of bit parts in TV comedy and began working on an idea for a sitcom about the Home Guard which he entitled The Fighting Tigers.Perry showed his idea to TV producer David Croft, who took it to the BBC's head of comedy, Michael Mills.The BBC had some initial reservations that the programme might be seen to be poking fun at the Home Guard, but Mills was persuaded to commission the first series.Mills changed the title to Dad's Army, renamed some of the characters and altered the fictional location to Walmington-on-Sea.Perry himself had envisaged playing the spiv, Private Walker, but David Croft, who was drafted in to help Perry with the scripts, advised against it.Many of Perry's characters in Dad's Army were taken from real life. One elderly soldier of his acquaintance recalled serving under Kitchener and became the inspiration for Corporal Jones.Private Pike was based on Perry himself, who recalled his mother's anxiety over her teenage son being out at night in the cold, defending the country. \"She didn't go so far as making me wear a scarf,\" Perry later recalled. \"But she came pretty near.\"Dad's Army first aired on 31 July 1968, with a total of 80 episodes appearing over the following nine years.Since then it has rarely been off the screen thanks to a series of repeats.As well as co-writing the script, Perry wrote the lyrics for the opening song, Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Mr Hitler, which he persuaded his great music hall idol, Bud Flanagan, to perform.The song won the 1971 Ivor Novello Award for Best TV Signature Tune.In 1969 Perry went solo to write The Gnomes of Dulwich, a sitcom that satirised the Common Market.Starring Terry Scott and Hugh Lloyd as concrete British gnomes threatened by their plastic European counterparts, the show ran for just six episodes.Dad's Army was still appearing regularly when Perry and Croft decided to draw on their wartime experiences in the Far East for It Ain't Half Hot Mum.The show centred on a British army concert party whose duty was to entertain the front-line troops. A similar scenario appeared in the 1977 film, Privates on Parade.The first episode was transmitted on 3 January 1974 and the series ran for more than seven years.In 1979 Perry again went out on his own to write the ITV sitcom, Room Service. Together with a later effort without Croft, High Street Blues, it became a contender for the worst British sitcom ever.The following year saw Perry and Croft back together again for Hi-de-Hi, based on Perry's experiences at Butlin's.Set in a 1950s holiday camp, the series ran for eight years and collected a Bafta in 1984 for Best Comedy Series. Perry wrote the theme tune, Holiday Rock.The series spawned a musical featuring most of the TV cast, which ran in Bournemouth, London and Blackpool in 1983 and 1984.Perry's final collaboration with David Croft came with You Rang M'Lord?, which turned out to be their least successful effort.Once again Perry based the idea on reality, this time the experiences of his grandfather who had been a butler in a large household.Unusually for a sitcom, the episodes were 50 minutes in length and featured high production values. Despite this, it was not well received by critics, although it ran for 26 episodes.In 2003 Perry and Croft received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the British Comedy Awards. The release of a film version of Dad's Army in 2016 divided fans of the series but Perry gave it his blessing by attending the premiere in London.Jimmy Perry was half of one of the most successful writing partnerships in TV comedy. In his memoir, Stupid Boy, he chronicled some of the real-life individuals on which he based  the likes of Captain Mainwaring, Corporal Jones, Gladys Pugh and the fearsome Sgt Major Williams. While Croft brought his experience as a producer and director it was Perry's great observational skills which peopled their work with such memorable characters.What are your memories of Jimmy Perry?

clothes","body":"Syrian refugee children have been making clothes for British shoppers, an undercover BBC investigation has found.Panorama investigated factories in Turkey and found children had been working on clothes for Marks and Spencer and the online retailer Asos.Refugees were also found working illegally on Zara and Mango jeans.All the brands say they carefully monitor their supply chains and do not tolerate the exploitation of refugees or children.Marks and Spencer says its inspections have not found a single Syrian refugee working in its supply chain in Turkey.But Panorama found seven Syrians working in one of the British retailer's main factories. The refugees often earned little more than a pound an hour - well below the Turkish minimum wage. They were employed through a middleman who paid them in cash on the street.One of the refugees told Panorama they were poorly treated at the factory. He said: \"If anything happens to a Syrian, they will throw him away like a piece of cloth.\"The youngest worker was 15 years old and he was working more than 12 hours a day ironing clothes before they were shipped to the UK.A spokesperson for Marks and Spencer said the programme's findings were \"extremely serious\" and \"unacceptable to M&S\". It is offering permanent legal employment to any Syrians who were employed in the factory. \"Ethical trading is fundamental to M&S. All of our suppliers are contractually required to comply with our Global Sourcing Principles, which cover what we expect and require of them and their treatment of workers. \"We do not tolerate such breaches of these principles and we will do all we can to ensure that this does not happen again.\"But critics say the retailers are not doing enough to stop the problems highlighted by Panorama.Danielle McMullan, from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre, says the brands need to understand that they are responsible: \"It's not enough to say we didn't know about this, it's not our fault. \"They have a responsibility to monitor and to understand where their clothes are being made and what conditions they are being made in.\"Many clothes are now made in Turkey because it is close to Europe and used to dealing with last-minute orders. This allows retailers to get new designs into shops more quickly than if they are made elsewhere.But Turkey is a challenging place to do business. Concerns are rising about the exploitation of workers after the arrival of almost three million Syrian refugees.Most of the refugees do not have work permits and many of them are working illegally in the garment industry.Panorama reporter Darragh MacIntyre spoke to dozens of Syrian workers who felt they were being exploited. He said: \"They speak of pitiful wages and terrible working conditions. They know they are being exploited but they know they can do nothing about it.\"In one back-street workshop in Istanbul, the programme team found several Syrian children hard at work. They also discovered an Asos sample in the office. Asos accepts its clothes were made in the factory, but says it is not an approved factory. The company has since inspected and found 11 Syrian adults and three Syrian children under 16 at work.Asos says the children will be financially supported so they can return to school and the adult refugees will be paid a wage until they have been found legal work. A spokesperson for the company said: \"We have implemented these remediation programmes despite the fact that this factory has nothing to do with Asos.\"The investigation also found Syrian refugees working 12-hour days in a factory that was distressing jeans for Mango and Zara. The refugees were involved in spraying hazardous chemicals to bleach the jeans, but most of the workers did not even have a basic face mask.Mango says that the factory was working as a sub-contractor without its knowledge. Its subsequent inspection did not find any Syrian workers and found \"good conditions except for some personal safety measures\". Zara's parent company, Inditex, says its factory inspections are a \"highly effective way of monitoring and improving conditions\".  It had already found significant non-compliance in an audit in June and had given the factory until December to make the necessary improvements. In another Istanbul factory, Panorama found Syrian adults at work alongside Turkish children as young as 10.The owner said he had been working for Next and showed the undercover team a set of Next pyjamas that he said the factory had helped produce.Next says the pyjamas were actually made by another supplier and the pyjamas we saw may have been a sample. It says samples circulate widely and that the presence of a sample in a factory does not mean it was made there.Panorama - Undercover: The Refugees Who Make Our Clothes is on BBC One at 20:30 BST on Monday October 24 and available on the BBC iPlayer afterwards.

off-grid for many year,  and recently he visited the woodland community at Tinkers Bubble in Somerset and spoke to some of those living close to the land.Ed Shaw, 29, has been living at the site for more than two years and has spent much of his life on the road, having found city life was not to his liking. \"Broadly I'd say that any change you make in your life, no matter how small the change, in living closer to nature, will make your life better and more worthwhile,\" he says.\"It could be the joy in your life, whatever that is, whether it's planting flowers or raising butterflies indigenous to your area or living like this, will make a difference. \"To be still, that's the joy of being settled. \"We have 300 volunteers who visit every year as they have realised how their lives have been and because of how they'd like their lives to be. \"There is a flow of people moving around who want to change their lives, and I think that will create a positive change in society.\"In contrast Ed's partner, Sophia, who is  training to be a Shiatsu practitioner, had not lived off-grid prior to moving to Tinkers Bubble, but had been doing an apprenticeship on a farm.\"It was a leap of faith to move here as I'd never really visited before, but it was an easy transition as I knew a few of the members already,\" she says.\"The interpersonal dynamics are the most rewarding but most challenging aspect of living in the community. \"It's unpredictable and button-pressing. \"It's a real blessing to feel connected to a group of people, it's a big family and that comes from bonded interpersonal relations. \"We get about 40 emails a day in the summer from people asking if they can volunteer and two or three every week from random people asking if they can live at Tinkers Bubble, so that's an indicator that people realise it's a better way to live, even if they romanticise the idea. \"It's not something that anyone can do, but it's better for mental health to live outside and getting away from the business and rush of day to day. \"The hardest thing is missing having a washing machine, because of the time. \"Washing my clothes by hand takes about three hours.\"Laura Axe, 30, moved here a year ago, having previously lived in a house in Switzerland that did not have electricity. \"It's very real here because we are trying to live as sustainably as possible, we are producing our food, it's something that feels very wholesome about this lifestyle,\" she says.\"People tend to go towards what they are drawn to, I work with the horses, milk the cow, food production. \"If it's a big project like the round house, re-thatching it and putting in more windows, we all help out.\"This is the longest I've stayed in one place for any length of time. \"I like it here. It says to me it is the way forward - positive steps, positive futures. \"For me, it's a real encouragement to know this place exists, it feels really supportive that you're part of a network that is growing. \"I think people are seeing a lot more sense in living this way. \"People are kind of changing their opinion or at least getting their own opinion on what is really important. \"I think it is starting to become very real to people that we can't continue with the consumerism lifestyle that we've had.\"Jen Joseph has spent most of her life on the move, both as a child and in recent years living in Europe and Africa, where she helped set up educational establishments for children. \"There's this window that is sensible to live within, you make things work within it,\" she says. \"The off-gridness fulfils my selfish need to have green around me. \"But if everybody wanted to have that space of green around them, it wouldn't be possible because there are too many people. \"I have more than my fair share, there aren't many people that can live like this.\"I feel absolutely privileged the fact that everywhere I look I have real diversity of landscape and am able to wander wherever I like. \"If you allowed people to live like this everywhere, it just wouldn't work.\"\"I have high hopes for the younger generation because I think they think more what it means to be part of this world.\"It's not about nationality or race or what you're entitled to, it's about compassion. \"Compassion in action, just giving up everything and doing the best you can.\"It was 1994 when Michael Zair arrived at the site having worked in a number of jobs, including as a buyer for J Lyons. \"I don't think I miss anything from living in a house, but there will come a time when my hip joints will struggle with the uneven ground here,\" he says.\"And if I have an operation for a hip replacement, it will take a while to recover and I will be quite dependent on other people.\"I've been here 22 years so I've been saving the government a lot of money on housing benefit. \"I feel very privileged, I have no desire to go and get housebound and dependent on the grid. \"If I had been married, I would never have come here. \"This is my family here and it's been an exciting adventure. \"Nine babies have been born here. \"It's sometimes been suggested that this place should be a template for the imagination - to have your dreams here and then go and have the chance to fulfil them.\"This is the first time Eden Evans, 22, has lived off-grid \"I'd heard lots of good things about Tinkers Bubble, and I'm doing a dissertation about eco villages, so I'm here to get first hand experience,\" she says.\"I'm interested in growing and gardening and being environmental. \"I'm studying social anthropology, and generally what I like to study is land attitude, which is the cosmology in how landscapes are used in general and affects people's lifestyle. \"The typical Western ideology is called naturalist cosmology, which has a tendency to view humans as an exception in their surroundings. \"It's a much less holistic view and more of a hierarchical view of doing things.\"\"Culturally, it's not easy to make a living whilst living in an off-grid community,\" says Jake.\"Living without fossil fuels is much more labour intensive and it's hard to find the balance. \"We do integrate with the local community, but there's an obvious distinction between living in the community and with the outside world. \"I won't deny that it's mentally and physically challenging, especially in winter. \"It's hard to live here as a musician, because of the way they are expected to live because of travelling around. \"If you want to be successful, you are expected to travel. \"I'm a live musician and you have to go to where the people are that want to see you. \"I don't know where I'm going to live next, probably in a city to teach English and play music.\"I'm a bit sad to leave. I've not come across another community like this in the UK. It's beautiful.\"Natalie Huss originally came to Britain from Germany to work in Scotland in nature conservation, but it was only when she decided to quit that job that she became interested in living in communities such as this. \"When I was younger I wanted to save the world, I wanted to be one of those on the [Greenpeace ship] Rainbow Warrior,\" she says.\"Over the years, I became more and more unsatisfied about the fact that I wasn't able to work in conservation as well as living a much more sustainable life. \"I lived in an ordinary house, used a car and other machinery for work, bought most of my food. \"I felt it was time to to quit my job and focus on living sustainably and close to the land. \"People feel like they have to get a job and do what everyone else is doing. \"People don't necessarily have a longing to live off-grid, but many have a longing to change their lives. \"People have such a fear and worry about pensions - but in return for paying into one, in possibly a job that they do not like, they just give up so much for a major part of their lives for so little at the end.\"All photographs © Ed Gold

Perry dies: 'Amazing' Dad's Army creator remembered","body":"Comedians and friends have paid tribute to the \"amazing\" contribution to British TV of Dad's Army creator Jimmy Perry, who has died at the age of 93.Perry's agent Tim Hancock said the writer, who was also behind Hi-de-Hi! and You Rang M'Lord?, had died at his home on Sunday after a short illness.He said he had \"never met anyone... with as big a heart as Jimmy\".Ian Lavender, who played Private Pike in Dad's Army, said Perry's death was \"the end of an era\".Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Hi-de-Hi! actress Ruth Madoc said: \"He was my great, great friend... he will be sorely missed.\"He understood comedy, and the comedy that he produced and wrote will stand the test of time. Lots of generations to come will love it still.\" Shane Allen, BBC controller of comedy commissioning, said Perry's shows would be remembered for many years to come.He said: \"Jimmy Perry is a Goliath of British comedy writing. He was behind some of the longest running and most loved sitcoms on British television spanning the 60s, 70s and 80s.\"In a tweet, comic Jack Dee said: \"RIP Jimmy Perry. Amazing contribution to British telly. Watched Dad's Army only yesterday. Still as funny as when I watched it as a kid.\"Simply Red singer Mick Hucknall and comedian Miranda Hart were among the other stars to take to Twitter to pay their respects to Perry.In his writing, Perry drew upon his own experiences of being in the Home Guard during World War Two and as a Redcoat at Butlin's holiday camp.Perry devised Dad's Army alongside producer David Croft and the pair also went on to create It Ain't Half Hot Mum, about an Army entertainment troupe during the war.Dad's Army ran from 1968 for 80 episodes over nine years and the character Private Pike was based on Perry himself. \"He has been a part of my life for such a long time, half of an amazing partnership,\" Ian Lavender added.Roy Gould, who worked as a production manager on Hi-de-Hi and You Rang M'Lord? said Perry was meticulous in his attention to detail.\"Jim always researched the material very, very, very well. In rehearsal and on location, Jim would have the script in his hand and make sure that everything was going absolutely right. He never left anything to chance,\" he told the BBC. 'Allo 'Allo! actress Vicki Michelle tweeted a photograph of herself with Perry, and wrote: \"So sad we have lost #JimmyPerry a brilliant comedy writer & true gentleman. He leaves us such a legacy.\"Perry also wrote some of his theme tunes, penning Holiday Rock for Hi-de-Hi! and winning an Ivor Novello Award in 1971 for the Dad's Army theme Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Mr Hitler?","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Comedian","freebaseTypes":["/film/film_subject","/book/book_subject","/people/profession","/fictional_universe/character_occupation"],"confidenceScore":2.562,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian","matchedText":"Comedians","freebaseId":"/m/018gz8","relevanceScore":0.3459,"entityEnglishId":"Comedian","startingPos":0,"endingPos":9,"wikidataId":"Q245068"},{"id":1,"type":["Work","TelevisionShow"],"matchingTokens":[2],"entityId":"Friends","freebaseTypes":["/tv/tv_program","/award/award_winning_work","/fictional_universe/work_of_fiction","/award/award_nominated_work","/media_common/netflix_title"],"confidenceScore":1.08,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends","matchedText":"friends","freebaseId":"/m/030cx","relevanceScore":0.4112,"entityEnglishId":"Friends","startingPos":14,"endingPos":21,"wikidataId":"Q79784"},{"id":2,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Country"],"matchingTokens":[13],"entityId":"United

As the candidate’s wife, I know him better than anyone, and I want to assure voters that the Donald Trump in these allegations is not the complete monster I married.Believe me, the misogynistic, lying, pathologically self-centered Donald I know is nothing like the one these women describe.I’ve been married to Donald Trump for more than 10 years now, and in all the times I’ve seen him treat other human beings as nothing more than objects for his own gratification, I’ve never seen him do the things he is currently being accused of.I realize my husband has his faults. He can be impulsive, short-tempered, cruel, arrogant, bigoted, thin-skinned, manipulative, hateful, defensive, intolerant, deluded, vindictive, greedy, perverted, narcissistic, dishonest, threatening, megalomaniacal, and psychopathic. But show me an irredeemably horrible, self-obsessed person who isn’t. What I have never personally seen him do, though, in all the years I’ve listened to him say demeaning and graphically sexual things about women, is touch someone without their consent.That is simply not the vicious, racist, dangerously unstable sociopath I wake up next to every morning.Now, am I by Donald’s side 24 hours a day? Of course not. But based on what I’ve experienced of him as a disgusting, reprehensible egomaniac who sees only himself and denies the humanity of others, it’s hard for me to imagine him doing the things these women accuse him of. Scapegoat racial minorities? Yes. Make veiled suggestions that someone should assassinate his opponent? Sure. Degrade and humiliate women at every opportunity in his personal and professional life? Of course. But assault? I just can’t see the loathsome demon I married doing something like that.In the coming days and weeks, the media is going to try to portray my husband as a lecherous, chauvinistic serial abuser. But what they don’t understand is that deep down inside, he’s just a prurient, sexist predator—one who doesn’t let anything get between him and the satisfaction of his immediate desires—and that’s it! Nothing more, nothing less.I know people will say that I’m deluding myself. That I can’t read the writing on the wall. That the only way I can be psychologically comfortable continuing to live alongside such a heartless, dangerous, malignant individual is by blindly convincing myself that he could never have committed the crimes that he’s been accused of and, indeed, bragged about on tape. All I can say is that when I see him in the morning before he goes to work and at night when he returns home, Donald is simply a human horror show who has never once given a moment of thought to the hopes, dreams, struggles, or circumstances of anyone else in existence. That’s my Donald.So before you rush to judgment, please, forget what the media is telling you for a moment, and try to see my husband the way I do: as a repugnant, repulsive cancer of a person who makes our world a crueler, more hateful place by his very existence.That’s the real Donald Trump.","entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[18,19],"entityId":"Presidential

journalist Tim Cascella reportedly found himself Thursday having to explain to several ISIS militants what BuzzFeed News is. “So, it’s part of a broader digital media network, and it started out as a spinoff from our entertainment content because that made more sense from an advertising perspective, but now it’s a separate news vertical of its own—it reports on stuff like any other news site, I swear,” said a frightened Cascella, who only seemed to perplex and anger his interrogators further when, after being asked to state his background, he mentioned that he got his start writing listicles for the website before eventually moving up to report on actual real-world events. “No, I don’t have a physical copy; it’s only online. We’re sort of like Huffington Post, if you’re familiar with that, but for a younger audience. Maybe you’ve done one of our quizzes? They’re very popular. If you just go to BuzzFeed.com—and try not to look at the homepage—then just click on ‘News,’ which is the first tab, it will bring you to actual news stories. I promise.” At press time, Cascella’s captors had decided to release him after determining that he was not a journalist.","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"HAWIJA","freebaseTypes":["/location/location"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"HAWIJA","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":0,"endingPos":6},{"id":1,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Country"],"matchingTokens":[2],"entityId":"Iraq","freebaseTypes":["/periodicals/newspaper_circulation_area","/symbols/flag_referent","/military/military_post","/book/book_subject","/location/statistical_region","/sports/sports_team_location","/organization/organization_member","/travel/travel_destination","/fictional_universe/fictional_setting","/organization/organization_founder","/olympics/olympic_participating_country","/location/country","/organization/organization_scope","/government/governmental_jurisdiction","/location/location","/location/dated_location","/military/military_combatant","/military/military_unit_place_of_origin"],"confidenceScore":6.829,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq","matchedText":"IRAQ","freebaseId":"/m/0d05q4","relevanceScore":0.173,"entityEnglishId":"Iraq","startingPos":8,"endingPos":12,"wikidataId":"Q796"},{"id":2,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[27,28],"entityId":"Tim

definitely not unclenching my muscles all the way—jeez, I’m doing terribly at this,” the 27-year-old reportedly thought to herself as she lay facedown on the massage table, repeatedly second-guessing

unless that would seem condescending. God, this is really stressing me out.” When asked by the massage therapist if the pressure being applied to her back felt good, Leigh reportedly nodded vigorously and said that the crushing pain she

Trump’s campaign website reportedly trains supporters to spot any suspicious skin colors they may see on Election Day, sources confirmed this week. “Keep an eye out for any of the skin tones appearing on the list below, none of which are allowable on November 8,” read the webpage in part, reminding volunteers that watching out for certain suspect and disreputable complexions was the only way to ensure the Republican nominee had a fair shot at winning the election. “Be on the lookout for these two shades in particular, as they have historically proven to cause significant trouble. And remember that whenever you spot a dubious-looking skin pigmentation at your polling place, immediately confront the problem head-on.” The site further stated that should a volunteer happen to notice a significantly high number of suspicious skin colors at their precinct, they should call their local Trump field office immediately so the campaign could formally contest the polling location’s results.","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[25],"entityId":"Donald

candidates. “We believe the continuation of this election by just over half a year will provide Americans with the chance to fully acquaint themselves with both the character and policy positions of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Trump,” said FEC chairman Matthew S. Petersen, who expressed confidence that the American people would benefit greatly from over 200 extra days of election coverage, rallies, press conferences, and campaign ads. “Our commission has also worked with the CPD to schedule eight more presidential debates and three more town halls, so that there will be no question that every citizen is ready to cast their ballot by the time Election Day comes around on June 8, 2017.” The FEC added that it had not ruled out extending the election by an additional year if any U.S. voters were still undecided.","entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Settlement","City"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Washington,

Hayden, prominent social activist, politician dead at 76","body":"Veteran social activist and politician Tom Hayden, a stalwart of America's New Left who served 18 years in California's state legislature and gained a dash of Hollywood glamour by marrying actress Jane Fonda, has died aged 76, according to media reports.Hayden died in Santa Monica, California, after a long illness, The Los Angeles Times reported on its website.\"A political giant and dear friend has passed,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wrote on Twitter, adding \"Tom Hayden fought harder for what he believed than just about anyone I have known.\"Hayden, who forged his political activism as a founding member of Students for a Democratic Society, which stood at the core of the 1960s anti-war and civil rights movements, was principal author of the group's revolutionary manifesto, the Port Huron Statement.The University of Michigan student ventured into the Deep South, where he joined voter registration campaigns and was arrested and beaten while taking part in the \"freedom rider\" protests against racial segregation.Hayden, however, became perhaps best known as one of the \"Chicago Eight\" activists tried on conspiracy and incitement charges following protests at the turbulent 1968 Democratic National Convention. He was ultimately acquitted of all charges.A New York Times book review of his 1988 memoir, \"Reunion,\" one of more than 20 books published under his name, called Hayden \"the single greatest figure of the 1960s student movement.\"Outliving contemporaries Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton, Hayden remained active in left-wing politics well into the 21st century, posting on  Twitter just a week ago. Winning election himself to the California state Assembly in 1982, and then the state Senate a decade later, Hayden went on to serve a total of 18 years.Later he became director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center, a nonprofit left-wing think tank devoted mainly to analysis of continued U.S. military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, drug policy and global poverty.Hayden was married to actress Jane Fonda from 1973 to 1990, with whom he had two children. Midway through their marriage, the couple graced the cover of People Magazine.In later years his writings were published in national publications including The New York Times, the Boston Globe and the Denver Post. He served on the editorial board and was a columnist for The Nation magazine, and was the author of more than 20 books.Tributes poured in on social media, including from actress Martha Plimpton, who wrote on Twitter: \"Rest in peace, Tom Hayden. And thank you. Love to all who knew & worked w him. Esp his family, and @Janefonda. He was a good man.\" (Reporting by Chris Michaud in New York and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Susan

for scrutiny in Washington","body":"WASHINGTON AT&T Inc's (T.N) proposed $85 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) generated skepticism among both Democrats and Republicans on Sunday, making it more likely that regulators will closely scrutinize the effort to create a new telecommunications and media giant.The biggest deal of the year, announced just over two weeks before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, is a gamble on a victory for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and a continuation of the status quo on anti-trust and regulatory enforcement.The Republican candidate Donald Trump, who is trailing Clinton in the polls, has said he would block the takeover.The billionaire businessman has railed against the media's role in what he has described as a \"rigged\" election and he believes the acquisition of Time Warner, which owns CNN and Warner Bros, Hollywood's largest film and television studio, would concentrate too much power in one organization. \"AT&T, the original and abusive 'Ma Bell' telephone monopoly, is now trying to buy Time Warner and thus the wildly anti-Trump CNN. Donald Trump would never approve such a deal because it concentrates too much power in the hands of the too and powerful few,\" Trump economic advisor Peter Navarro said in a statement on Sunday.Clinton, who has expressed misgivings about other corporate mega mergers, has not yet commented on the takeover.But Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton's former rival for the Democratic party's nomination, said on Twitter that the administration should \"kill\" the Time Warner takeover because it would mean higher prices and fewer choices for consumers.Sanders' comments carry weight because Clinton needs Sanders' coalition of young and left-leaning voters to propel her to the presidency.Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon told reporters on Sunday there were \"a number of questions and concerns\" about the deal \"but there's still a lot of information that needs to come out before any conclusions should be reached.\"The Senate subcommittee on antitrust will hold a hearing on the acquisition sometime in November, said subcommittee chair Senator Mike Lee, a Republican, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Amy Klobuchar. Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate and a senator from Virginia, said lawmakers and regulators would have to review the deal and \"get to the bottom\" of questions over whether the merger would decrease competition.\"Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful especially in the media,\" Kaine said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" The U.S. Justice Department, not the president, has the power to reject such a deal if it violates antitrust laws. AT&T said it is unclear if the Federal Communications Commission will also have jurisdiction to review the deal.A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.AT&T has described the deal as a \"vertical merger\" because there is no overlap between the two companies and hopes that such a tie-up will get the regulatory green light by the end of 2017.“In the modern history of the media and the Internet, the U.S. government has always approved vertical mergers like ours, because they benefit consumers, strengthen competition, and, in our case, encourage innovation and investment,” David McAtee, AT&T senior executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement on Sunday.The Time Warner takeover mirrors the 2013 $30 billion purchase of NBCUniversal by its rival Comcast (CMCSA.O), a deal which was cleared after regulators imposed concessions on the cable operator.COMPETITORS ENVISION 'CLOSE' SCRUTINYThe cash and stock deal brings together two very different companies -- one a telecoms company that traces its heritage back to Alexander Graham Bell, the other an entertainment company founded in the Hollywood of the 1920s.But the tie-up, which is designed to boost the content AT&T can stream over its network, raises concerns that AT&T might try to limit distribution of Time Warner material.Competitors such as NBCUniversal, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) and the Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) could find that their content could be put at a disadvantage, some consumer advocacy groups suggested. \"A transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,\" said Zenia Mucha, chief communications officer for Disney.NBC Universal, which is owned by Comcast Corp and Fox declined to comment on the merger. Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, speaking on Saturday at the Institute on Entertainment Law and Business conference at the University of Southern California, said he expected a close examination of the deal by regulators.CONGRESSIONAL EXAMINATIONSenators Lee and Klobuchar said their subcommittee would \"carefully review\" the merger to make sure it does not harm consumers.    Lawmakers may pursue inquiries into the merger and build support for or against it, but it is ultimately up to the Justice Department to approve, block or place conditions on the deal. Two of the biggest congressional critics of the mega-mergers among media companies and elsewhere in the U.S. economy said late on Saturday that they would take a hard look at this deal.Senator Richard Blumenthal, who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted the proposed acquisition would combine a wireless company, a pay-TV provider and a studio.\"I will be looking closely at what this merger means for consumers and their pocketbooks and whether it stands up to ‎the rigorous review standards set by the Department of Justice's antitrust division in the last few years,\" he said.Senator Al Franken, who is also on the Judiciary Committee, said that the deal raised \"immediate flags.\"\"I'm skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices, and even worse service for consumers,\" he said. \"And regulators often agree, like when Comcast unsuccessfully tried to buy Time Warner Cable, a deal that I fiercely opposed.\" (Additional reporting by David

presidential election will inject a hefty dose of volatility into U.S. stock markets are fading fast as Republican Donald Trump's victory odds lengthen.A reading of positioning data on options tied to the benchmark S&P 500 index shows little pickup in demand for contracts that would offer investors downside insurance in the event that stock prices take a major hit right after the Nov. 8 election.Moreover, based on options term structures - calculated from prices of options with different expirations - it is hardly evident at all that investors are positioning for an uncertain outcome, even with Election Day barely two weeks away, Michael Purves, head of derivatives research at Weeden & Co, said.\"There had been a modest premium bump for November options a few weeks ago, but that seems to have faded steadily with Trump's slide in polls,\" Purves said.In a Reuters poll of equity strategists earlier this month, a victory by Democrat Hillary Clinton was viewed as the more positive outcome for stock prices in the near term. Trump's chances of defeating Clinton to capture the White House have diminished markedly over the last several weeks, according to most polls and prediction markets.The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which uses an online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that Clinton has a better than 95 percent chance of winning the minimum of 270 Electoral College votes to claim the presidency if the election were held today. The most likely outcome would be 326 votes for Clinton to 212 for Trump.On PredictIt, a popular online predictions and betting market, Clinton's implied chances of victory have risen to around 80 percent from around 63 percent a month ago.NO RUSH FOR INSURANCE      The lack of positioning for an election-related volatility shock is consistent across the options market.\"I just don't see a whole lot of shifting of positions. I don't see people taking on a very bearish stance or anything like that. It's a little bit surprising,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director, trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, Austin, Texas.\"If it was a much closer race it might have been a different story, but the polls have Hillary Clinton in a pretty solid lead right now and the market seems to be on board with that idea,\" Frederick said.A Brookings Institution study published on Friday from two U.S. economics professors concluded that a Clinton victory would further suppress stock market volatility, whereas a Trump victory would send it soaring.Justin Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, and Eric Zitzewitz, of Dartmouth College, said recent market reactions to pre-election events, including the first Trump-Clinton debate and the release of a video of Trump making vulgar comments about women, signal that equity volatility could fall by 15 to 30 percent with a Clinton win. (tinyurl.com/zl4ew4u)TRUMP \"INSURANCE\" IS CHEAPWhile the options market might be only a moderate catalyst for the S&P 500 index, individual sectors such as healthcare and energy might be more prone to election-related volatility, derivatives analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a recent note.And just because investors are not braced for election-linked stock gyrations is no guarantee that markets will remain calm, analysts said.Given that the market is not pricing a lot of volatility for November, the absence of positioning could aggravate a volatility shock in the event of a surprise result.\"If you think Trump will win, you want to get long SPX puts or long CBOE Volatility Index calls right now as protection,\" said Purves, referring to options contracts that profit from a jump in volatility.A clean sweep by the Democrats of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House could also unleash volatility, Purves said.Indeed, there is a very modest skew toward protective put options over more bullish calls among contracts expiring near the election. For S&P 500 index weekly contracts expiring on Nov. 11, puts outnumber calls by a 2.1-to-1 margin, compared with 1.9-to-1 for all expirations, according to Thomson Reuters data.Prices for at-the-money put and call contracts that expire on the eve of the election suggest a 1.8 percent move, up or down, in the S&P 500 by then, while comparable contracts expiring later that week see an up or down move of 2.1 percent.Nonetheless, demand for volatility protection remains low and such options are relatively cheap, and getting cheaper. For instance, the cost for an S&P index option conveying the right to sell an S&P index future at the 2,050 level, about 4 percent below Friday's close, and expiring on Nov. 9, the day after the election, has plunged from $12.42 on Monday to $4.80 on Friday, a 61 percent decline.With Trump trailing in opinion polls, the focus ahead of the Nov. 8 vote is shifting to whether Republicans can keep their narrow majority in the Senate or even their larger advantage in the House of Representatives.\"Gridlock is the most market friendly outcome, and that is what the options market seems to be anticipating,\" Purves said.

taken the town of Bashiqa near Mosul from Islamic State on Sunday as coalition forces pressed their offensive against the jihadists' last stronghold in Iraq.Masoud Barzani, President of the Iraqi Kurdish region, told U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter that the Kurds had succeeded in liberating Bashiqa from Islamic State.Kurdish Peshmerga fighters told reporters at the scene that they had entered Bashiqa. Journalists were not being allowed into the town, which lies 12 km (8 miles) northeast of Mosul. The offensive to take Mosul, by Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition, is expected to become the biggest battle in the country since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The capture of Bashiqa, if confirmed, would mark the removal of one more obstacle on the road to the northern city. The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Army Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, said his own information - while limited - \"suggests that President Barzani is right, that there has been a considerable success at Bashiqa\". But he added: \"I have not received a report that says every house has been cleared, every Daesh (Islamic State fighter) has been killed and every IED (roadside bomb) has been removed.\" Townsend told journalists that Bashiqa was one of the villages outside Mosul that Islamic State had emptied of civilians and fortified over the past two years.Reuters television footage from Nawran, a town near Bashiqa, showed Kurdish fighters using a heavy mortar, a machine gun and small arms as smoke rose over the area.As Peshmerga forces moved though the area, armored vehicles moved along a road and a helicopter flew overhead.The Peshmerga are also using tanks, rocket launchers and snipers. A Reuters photographer saw the fighters destroy at least three suicide car bombs dispatched against their forces.Turkish artillery is supporting the Peshmerga, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was quoted as saying by CNN Turk and other media outlets. \"The Peshmerga have mobilized to cleanse the Bashiqa region from Daesh. They asked for help from our soldiers at the Bashiqa base. So we are helping the tanks with our artillery there,\" CNN Turk quoted him as saying. Turkey has troops at a base in the area where it has been helping to train Iraqi Kurdish fighters. The artillery support could further strain relations between Ankara and the Baghdad central government, coming a day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declined an offer from Turkey to take part in the Mosul campaign.    MOSUL DRIVEThe offensive to capture Mosul started on Monday. Coalition forces have advanced to within 5 km (3 miles) of the city at the closest point, the interior minister of the Kurdish regional government has said.An Iraqi force of about 30,000, joined by U.S. special forces and under American, French and British air cover, is ready to push into Mosul after recapturing Falluja and Ramadi, west of Baghdad, and seizing the Sunni stronghold of Tikrit in central Iraq.Islamic State have staged attacks apparently aimed at distracting the advancing forces. They hit the city of Kirkuk on Friday and on Sunday they attacked Rutba, a town 360 km (225 miles) west of Baghdad, where they killed at least seven policemen, according to a police source.The mayor, Imad al-Dulaimi, said the insurgents attacked during the night and gained entry to the town by coordinating with sleeper cells there. About 30 insurgents skirmished with tribal fighters and security forces before vanishing.Townsend said Islamic State had staged what he called a complex attack in Rutba, which was being dealt with by Iraqi forces. The attack was intended \"to try to draw our attention from Mosul\", he said. In an attempt to repel the offensive against Mosul, Islamic State also set fire to a sulfur plant near the city. Up to 1,000 people were treated in hospital after inhaling toxic fumes.EXPLOSIVESCoalition officials have said the offensive is going well, but that it will take a long time to recapture Mosul, which has a civilian population of 1.5 million.Between 4,000 and 8,000 Islamic State fighters have rigged the city with explosives, built oil-filled moats, dug tunnels, and trenches and are feared to be ready to use civilians as human shields.Carter sounded optimistic about the campaign to take Mosul during a trip to Erbil as he praised the Kurdish region's Peshmerga fighters. \"I'm here to commend you and your forces. I’m encouraged by what I see,\" Carter told Barzani during talks.Peshmerga spokesman Brigadier General Halgord Hekmet told reporters that 25 Kurdish forces had been killed so far.\"There (are) a lot of wounded,\" Hekmet said, speaking through a translator. He spoke positively about air support his forces were receiving from the coalition but said more military assistance was needed, starting with armored vehicles and equipment to detect roadside bombs.\"Most of our Peshmerga got killed because they were riding in regular cars, not armored,\" Hekmet said. During the meeting, Barzani said the Mosul operation had started successfully and cited good progress over the past three days. He thanked the United States and the coalition for their support.In Rome, Pope Francis said he was close to the Iraqi people and in particular to the citizens of Mosul.\"Our souls are shaken by the brutal acts of violence that for too long have been carried out against innocent citizens, be they Muslim, Christian or from other ethnic and religious groups.\"  He had been saddened by reports that numerous people, including many children, had been \"killed in cold blood\".

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called Donald Trump a \"sore loser\" on Sunday because of his refusal at their debate last week to commit to accepting the results of the Nov. 8 election.Clinton, a former secretary of state, said Trump's comments were more consistent with what dictators in non-democratic countries might say about their opponents.\"To say you won’t respect the results of the election, that is a direct threat to our democracy,\" Clinton told a rally at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \"The peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes America America.\"\"And look, some people are sore losers, and we just got to keep going,\" she added.Earlier on Sunday, Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, acknowledged that the Republican presidential candidate was lagging behind Clinton ahead of the election.Conway said Clinton had \"tremendous advantages,\" including a large campaign war chest that had allowed her to spend millions on television ads. \"We are behind,\" Conway said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" But she added the Trump campaign was looking to sway undecided voters not ready to support Clinton.As the polling gap has widened, Trump has said repeatedly the election is being \"rigged\" against him. He has not offered evidence and numerous studies have shown that the U.S. election system, which is decentralized and run by the states, is sound.At last week's debate with Clinton in Las Vegas, Trump was asked if he would honor the result of the U.S. election.\"What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?\" Trump said.EARLY VOTINGAs she visited North Carolina, Clinton urged her supporters to participate in early voting.\"From now until Nov. 5, you can vote early at any voting location in your county. And you know, this is a big deal,” Clinton said at a campaign event in Raleigh.Campaigning in Naples, Florida, on Sunday, Trump also encouraged voters to go to the polls to vote both for him and Republicans running for Congress and other offices.\"You have 16 days to make this happen, but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me re-elect Republicans all over the place.\"\"I hope they help me too. Be nice if they help us too, right?\" said Trump, who has sparred with many prominent members of his party, including U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the country's top elected Republican.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday had Clinton leading Trump by 4 percentage points, and the most recent State of the Nation project showed Clinton with a 95 percent chance of winning the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the presidency.An ABC News poll released on Sunday morning had Clinton leading with 50 percent of likely support, compared with Trump's 38 percent. The poll found that the number of Republicans who said they were likely to vote fell 7 percentage points from mid-October.As Trump battled to win over undecided voters, advisers and members of his inner circle sought to downplay his remarks about the integrity of the election, in an indication he would come under significant pressure to accept the election results if he were to lose. Republican Party Chairman Reince Priebus said that by asking Trump to agree to concede, the media were making an extraordinary request. He said Trump would only fight if the election were close and was not trying to dispute a fair election. \"That’s not quite what he’s saying. What he’s saying is he wants to reserve all options and if there is ground for a recount, I’ll reserve all options,\" Priebus said on CBS's \"Face The Nation.\" Trump's son Eric said on Sunday that Trump would \"100 percent\" accept the results of the election if the outcome is \"fair.\"“I think what my father is saying is, 'I want a fair election,’” Eric Trump said on ABC's \"This Week.\" “If it’s a fair outcome, he will absolutely accept it. There’s no question about that.\"On Sunday, Trump picked up his first endorsement of the general election from a major newspaper when the Las Vegas Review-Journal backed his candidacy. The newspaper is owned by Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who has been reluctant to donate to Trump. In 2012, Adelson spent about $150 million trying to help elect Republican Mitt Romney.

cross-border transaction between banks using multiple blockchain applications has taken place, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo & Co said on Monday, resulting in a shipment of cotton to China from the United States.Australian cotton trader Brighann Cotton Marketing bought the shipment bound for the port city Qingdao from U.S. division Brighann Cotton in Texas, the companies and their banks said in a joint statement. The blockchain trade, for 88 bales, totaled $35,000, Commonwealth Bank told Reuters.Blockchain is a web-based transaction-processing and settlement system whose efficiency banks say could slash costs. It creates a \"golden record\" of any given set of data that is automatically replicated for all parties in a secure network, eliminating any need for third-party verification.\"Existing trade finance processes are ripe for disruption and this proof of concept demonstrates how companies around the world could benefit from these emerging technologies,\" Michael Eidel, Commonwealth Bank's executive general manager for cashflow and transaction services, said in the statement.The transaction is not the first involving the decentralized database, used since 2009 for the digital currency bitcoin. But it is a milestone for the traditional banking industry which at first shied away from the technology, partly because it makes money flows harder for law enforcement agencies to track.Led by a consortium of over 70 of the world's biggest financial institutions - called R3 - the banking industry has been researching ways to harness the speed, accuracy and efficiency afforded by blockchain.One of its benefits is removing people from transaction processing. That has been seen as especially appealing for cross-border trades, which are typically held up by duplication of payment processing and time zone differences.R3 has been researching ways to expand the use of blockchain to include \"smart contracts\", or payments triggered when certain conditions are met. The cotton transaction, for instance, involved automatically making payments when the shipment reached certain geographic locations, the statement showed.The shipment is currently between Singapore and Hong Kong, and is due to arrive in early November, Commonwealth Bank said. The bank also said that R3 - of which it and Wells Fargo are members - did not play a part in the trade.Brighann Cotton was not available for comment when contacted by Reuters.Wells Fargo's head of international trade services, Chris Lewis, said in the statement that his bank was committed to new technology. He also said \"significant regulatory, legal and other concerns remain to be addressed.\" (Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Christopher
