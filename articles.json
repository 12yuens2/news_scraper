[{"title":"Biplane adventurer Tracey Curtis-Taylor stripped of award","body":"A British adventurer has been stripped of an award over claims she lied about flying solo on an 8,000-mile trip. \nTracey Curtis-Taylor, 54, flew from Cape Town to Goodwood in Sussex in 2013 in an open cockpit Boeing Stearman.\nShe said she had intended to make the journey in the biplane flying solo, but denied she had made \"false assertions\".\nMs Curtis-Taylor said: \"A combination of elements resulted in fundamental changes being made to the nature of that expedition.\"\nThe Light Aircraft Association (LAA) has stripped Ms Curtis-Taylor of the Bill Woodhams trophy awarded for navigation.\nA spokesman for the association said a motion to \"rescind an award of the Bill Woodhams Trophy, made in 2014\" had been carried at the association's annual general meeting on Saturday. \nMs Curtis-Taylor said: \"I began with the intention of trying to fly the Africa flight solo but a combination of elements resulted in fundamental changes being made to the nature of that expedition.\n\"I have never made false assertions about the nature of my flights.\"\nShe said several people had flown with her on multiple legs between Cape Town and the UK, including her engineer Ewald Gritsch. \nMr Gritsch said his role was the \"reassembly of the airplane in Cape Town and the technical support during the expedition\".\nHe said: \"I had to take over the flight planning across Africa at short notice, which was done together with the professional African pilots in our team and two major aviation companies.\"\nSam Rutherford, who was the logistics manager on the flight, was in a plane flying behind Ms Curtis-Taylor's biplane. \nHe said: \"It's a great shame personally for Tracey, but the right decision for the LAA.\n\"You are meant to be the only human being in an aircraft.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[2,3],"entityId":"Tracey

probe attempted car attack murder on two officers","body":"Two police officers have been seriously injured in a hit-and-run car attack in Glasgow, which is being treated as attempted murder.\nThe officers were trying to speak to people inside the car, in Banner Drive, Knightswood, at 23:15 on Sunday, when it was deliberately reversed into them.\nThe 30-year-old female officer is in intensive care and her 31-year-old male colleague also remains in hospital. \nThe Scottish Police Federation has criticised Police Scotland's response.\nA blue Nissan Qashqai which had been at the scene was later found burned out in Lennox Gardens in the Scotstoun area of the city, although it has not yet been established whether it was the vehicle used in the attack. \nDet Insp Ian Hylands said: \"Despite the damage, forensic officers will carry out a comprehensive examination of the car.  \n\"Everything that can be done to locate the suspects is being done but I would like to appeal to anyone who may have seen the incident last night or who has any knowledge of the vehicle or the suspects to contact us.  \n\"Two police officers, in responding to an incident to help protect the public, have been badly injured. Help us find those responsible.\"\nThe Scottish Police Federation (SPF), which represents all ranks below superintendent, expressed solidarity with the officers but was also critical of the initial police response.\nSPF chairman Brian Docherty said: \"Our colleagues were simply doing their damnedest to keep the public safe and faced an unconscionable attack on their lives as a consequence. \n\"This is a despicable and cowardly act and there can be no doubt that those who drove a vehicle at police officers did so with the intention of taking their life. \n\"The SPF is fully supporting the officers, their families and friends at this incredibly difficult time.\"\nMr Docherty added: \"We will be raising with the Police Service of Scotland why almost 12 hours had passed before we were made aware of this horrific incident.\n\"We will also be asking why the power of traditional and social media was not immediately deployed to help trace these criminals. \n\"The Police Service of Scotland social media accounts are amongst the most followed in the country and could have alerted thousands to the fact dangerous criminals were being sought.\" \nPolice Scotland has denied there was any unnecessary delay in making information public.\nAssistant Chief Constable Wayne Mawson said: \"It is important to ensure that the facts are fully established around any incident so we can provide accurate information for an appeal to the public. As soon as we were notified of the incident an investigation was launched by detectives in Glasgow and efforts were made to inform next of kin. \n\"An appeal to the public was part of the investigative strategy. The facts were established and a release was drawn up and issued to media outlets following clearance processes. \n\"Police Scotland will continue to liaise with the Scottish Police Federation.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[5],"entityId":"Murder","freebaseTypes":["/book/book_subject","/law/legal_subject","/celebrities/reason_for_arrest","/film/film_subject","/people/cause_of_death","/media_common/quotation_subject"],"confidenceScore":0.9616,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder","matchedText":"murder","freebaseId":"/m/0fnpnn","relevanceScore":0.1408,"entityEnglishId":"Murder","startingPos":34,"endingPos":40,"wikidataId":"Q132821"}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"Police","freebaseTypes":["/fictional_universe/fictional_organization_type","/film/film_subject","/interests/collection_category","/organization/organization_sector","/book/book_subject","/tv/tv_genre","/media_common/quotation_subject","/organization/organization_type","/media_common/media_genre","/film/film_genre"],"confidenceScore":1.297,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police","matchedText":"police","freebaseId":"/m/05ws7","relevanceScore":0.3188,"entityEnglishId":"Police","startingPos":4,"endingPos":10,"wikidataId":"Q35535"},{"id":1,"matchingTokens":[1,2],"entityId":"Police

Look, I Wish I Were Better At This Also\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"The 2016 presidential race is unlike any we’ve seen before. Americans are as fed up as they’ve ever been with establishment politics, the nation is confronted with the two least popular major-party nominees in modern history, and people everywhere seem hungry for a change to the status quo. As a result, there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here for a third-party candidate to present a transformative new vision for our nation and win the support of voters all across the country. And frankly, I am just as disappointed as you are to realize I am in no way qualified to do that.\nLook, I get it. I really do. I wish I were better at this too.\nWhat can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.\nThird-party candidates usually get pushed to the sidelines, where they compete for a tiny fraction of the electorate, but this year, with so many voters deeply dissatisfied with the Republican and Democratic nominees, we’re getting far more attention. As it turns out, though, being a high-profile presidential candidate requires you to do a lot of stuff you don’t have to do when you’re only pulling in 1 percent of the vote, like know all about foreign affairs and domestic policy.\nThe appearances on national television, the greater publicity given to my platform and qualifications, the chance to connect with a wider variety of voters—these are all things that would come as welcome challenges to a knowledgeable and competent candidate. But as you can probably tell by now, I am simply not up to the task. Not even close.\nWhat can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.\nI do think that I did a pretty good job as the Libertarian Party nominee last time. In 2012, hardly anyone was listening to what I had to say, so it’s not like I had to worry about being asked to explain my views on international relations or the feasibility of my tax policy or anything like that. This time around, we’ve been polling a lot better—which is great!—but it also means that I’ve had to field questions on all kinds of subjects I just don’t have any clue about. It’s actually been pretty embarrassing.\nLike a lot of you, I didn’t expect this election season to turn out the way it has. When we started out with more than 20 candidates competing for the Democratic and Republican nominations, who would have guessed that we’d end up with two nominees who are disliked and distrusted by a majority of Americans? I figured that at this point in the year, I’d be doing the typical third-party thing: you know, scraping together a couple million votes from independents and people on the ideological fringe. Instead, tens of millions of people are taking a serious look at my candidacy, which is something I clearly was not capable of dealing with. Whoops.\nIt’s frustrating, because what we have here is a great chance to show voters they have options besides the Democratic and Republican parties, which keep offering the same tired ideas we’ve tried a hundred times before. But at the same time, we have me, sitting there for yet another interview where I’m asked very basic questions about current events and blanking like an idiot. I’m not just letting myself down—I’m letting down everyone who’s looking for a credible alternative to two deeply flawed major-party nominees.\nIt sucks! I don’t know what else to tell you.\nWhat makes it really disappointing is that I truly believe libertarianism has valuable ideas to contribute to America’s political discourse. And just in general, I think it would be great to have at least one viable choice out there besides the two major parties, which on many issues, like corporate influence and federal spending, aren’t all that different. But boy oh boy, am I ever doing a shitty job of communicating all that. Voters deserve to hear about these policies from someone who can intelligently and persuasively represent them. But instead you’ve got me. Sorry.\nEven worse is that it’s probably going to be decades before any third-party candidate has a chance like this again. The two leading candidates supported a failed war that destabilized the Middle East, backed a criminal justice system that preys on racial minorities, and come with decades’ worth of personal baggage. What more could I have asked for? This is probably the best shot we’re ever going to get, and here I am wasting it for everyone.\nOh well, at least I’m not blowing it as badly as Jill Stein.\n","title_entities":[],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":4,"endingPos":8},{"id":1,"type":["Place","PopulatedPlace","Country"],"matchingTokens":[12],"entityId":"United

things, so we could probably just type the candidates’ political positions and experience into a computer, press the Enter key, and then in a second or two, it should be able to tell us who should be president,” read the report in part, which confirmed that computers know how to drive cars and one of them even won Jeopardy!, so picking the best choice for president shouldn’t be that hard. “We probably wouldn’t even need to have candidates or campaigns or anything. Every four years, you could just put all Americans’ names into the computer, run the president program, let it figure out who’s the best person for the job, and then that person can get right to work, and that’d be it. Done.” The report went on to add that, come to think of it, given how quickly technology was advancing, we could probably just have a computer be the

the unattended confections from afar, area marketing associate Dan Keegan reportedly approached a box of powdered doughnuts Monday like a pine snake discovering an unguarded clutch of bluebird eggs.

The office worker is then said to have wasted no time consuming the sugarcoated treats that—much like eggs in an unattended nest of woven grass—sat there fully exposed and vulnerable in an open pastry box, swallowing all four of them nearly whole one after the other and then slipping back out from where he came before anyone could notice.

and its effects on a grieving father","body":"When Jack Davis and his partner Leanne McGregor lost their two baby sons through miscarriage, he received messages asking how the mother was coping. He understood, but was upset, thinking: \"What about me?\"\nIt has been a year since the couple lost their first child, Joey, who was born prematurely at 22 weeks.\nThe pain of what happened has not subsided, but for the first time he has begun to open up, having previously worried that discussing the subject might cause his partner further anguish.\n\"I was so focused on looking after Leanne, I didn't want to show her I was weak or as down as she was,\" he explained to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\"I thought that might have affected her as well, so I kept it inside and bottled it all up.\"\nA 22-year-old soldier, Jack admits that the \"military mindset\" may have contributed to his initial decision to \"man up\" and remain silent.\nBut, after being encouraged by Leanne, he has now written a blog about the emotional impact the loss of his two sons has had on him. It has since become widely shared, with goodwill messages and other people's stories flooding back. \nHe hopes other men will benefit from hearing his story.\nJack had been at work when he first received a call from Leanne - crying in pain - on 17 October 2015. He rushed home to find an ambulance outside.\nThe couple were taken to hospital and - as time progressed - he began to understand \"the inevitable\", that Leanne was having a miscarriage.\n\"As a young man, 21 years old at the time - Leanne was also 21 - and this being our first child, we had no idea what to do. I wasn't sure how to react in that moment.\n\"It had such an impact on us. We were so ready to be parents, even at a young age,\" he says.\nJack says that once they had discovered they were to become parents, he and Leanne had prepared themselves mentally for the occasion - making the miscarriage all the more heartbreaking.\n\"We suddenly grew up, we matured,\" he explains. \"And then to be told you're not going to be parents - I'm not sure how anyone's supposed to deal with that.\n\"To go from being so happy and elated about having your own child, doing all the things you're meant to do as a child - and then finding out that's been taken away from you.\"\nThe Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.\nAfter the funeral, Jack went back to work in an attempt to restore some normality. But, as he did so, he also kept his emotions to himself.\n\"When I asked him how he was he would just say 'I'm fine', when I knew that he really wasn't,\" Leanne says. \"He just wouldn't open up to me, at all.\"\nBy trying to stay strong, Leanne says he began to isolate himself and act out of character.\n\"He's normally quite an open person. So seeing him not talking wasn't nice to watch.\"\nA few months later, Leanne fell pregnant again.\nThe couple had been for scans that suggested \"everything was fine\", Jack says. But at 24 weeks pregnant - just a week after they had been on holiday together - Leanne went into labour.\n\"With it being 24 weeks, we had a bit of hope,\" Jack explains. \"There was a minimal chance [of baby Tommy surviving]- something to hold on to and hope for.\" But the couple experienced a second trauma, when Tommy passed away days later.\nJack refers to Leanne as \"Wonder Woman\" and says he can't imagine how she coped with the loss, but had hoped others would realise he was hurting too.\n\"The main focus stereotypically is the woman, but people forget in the background there's a man there supporting that woman.\n\"There's a man there that's got to go through all of this as well. The father's lost his children too.\"\nJack says people would message him asking \"how's Leanne?\". \n\"I'd get a bit upset, and say 'What about me? I'm hurting too'\" he adds. \"Men hurt, men have feelings.\"\nHe hopes, however, that the blog will enable others to understand the affects a miscarriage can have on a male partner, and - through the response it has generated - believes it has already started to have the desired affect.\n\"I think there's a different outlook now the blog's out there,\" he says.\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Disease"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Miscarriage","freebaseTypes":["/medicine/icd_9_cm_classification","/medicine/disease","/people/cause_of_death","/book/book_subject","/fictional_universe/medical_condition_in_fiction"],"confidenceScore":1.559,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage","matchedText":"Miscarriage","freebaseId":"/m/0127lb","relevanceScore":0.05933,"entityEnglishId":"Miscarriage","startingPos":0,"endingPos":11,"wikidataId":"Q28693"}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Person","Artist","ComicsCreator"],"matchingTokens":[1,2],"entityId":"Jack

the unattended confections from afar, area marketing associate Dan Keegan reportedly approached a box of powdered doughnuts Monday like a pine snake discovering an unguarded clutch of bluebird eggs. According to sources, Keegan’s tongue momentarily darted from his mouth and his gaze remained fixed on his quarry as he maneuvered his way toward the cluster of small white delicacies, silently creeping up to the tabletop as if he were making his way along a tree bough to an awaiting roosting site. The office worker is then said to have wasted no time consuming the sugarcoated treats that—much like eggs in an unattended nest of woven grass—sat there fully exposed and vulnerable in an open pastry box, swallowing all four of them nearly whole one after the other and then slipping back out from where he came before anyone could notice. At press time, a motionless Keegan was reportedly sunning himself by his office window, his stomach still bulging from the

doesn't exist, it doesn't appear to me at the moment that there is a UK negotiating strategy,\" she told Sky News television.\nWhile England and Wales voted for Brexit in a June referendum, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, setting the devolved governments in Edinburgh and Belfast on a collision course with the UK's central government in London.\nThis could lead to a constitutional crisis, and potentially to Scottish independence and renewed political tensions in Northern Ireland.\nAt the meeting with Sturgeon and the Welsh and Northern Irish leaders, May proposed setting up a new body to give the three devolved governments, which have varying degrees of autonomy from London, a formal avenue to express their views.\n\"Working together, the nations of the United Kingdom will make a success of leaving the European Union -- and we will further strengthen our unique and enduring union as we do so,\" May said in a statement after the talks.\nBut Sturgeon struck a very different tone as she emerged.\n\"What I'm not prepared to do ... is stand back and watch Scotland driven off a hard Brexit cliff edge because the consequences in lost jobs, lost investment and lower living standards are too serious,\" she said.\n\nCONFLICTING PRIORITIES\nThe British government, which has promised to kick off formal divorce talks with the EU before the end of March, has said it will negotiate a bespoke deal on behalf of the whole United Kingdom with the bloc's other 27 members.\nSturgeon said she would make specific proposals over the next few weeks to keep Scotland in the single market even if the rest of the UK left, and that May had said she was prepared to listen to options.\n\"So far those words are not matched by substance or actions and that is what has got to change,\" Sturgeon said.\nSturgeon, head of the Scottish National Party, has said her government is preparing for all possibilities, including independence from the UK, after Britain leaves the EU. She wants each of the UK's four assemblies to get a vote on the proposed negotiating package.\nIn Northern Ireland, there are fears that Brexit could undermine a 1998 peace deal and lead to the reintroduction of unpopular and cumbersome controls on the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.\nNorthern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the devolved nations had to be at \"the heart of the process\" so that issues relevant to them could be tackled as they arose.\nWelsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said it was difficult for the devolved administrations to influence the process when there was so much uncertainty over what the government was seeking.\nJones said he had argued very strongly for \"full and unfettered access\" to the EU's single market, which is in doubt because EU leaders say it would require Britain to continue to accept EU freedom of movement rules. \nOne of the central planks of the pro-Brexit campaign was that exiting the EU would give Britain greater control over immigration and help reduce the numbers arriving in the country.\n\n (Additional reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary, William James and Kate Holton; Editing by Estelle Shirbon and

moment she lost contact with her rock climber boyfriend - who died during an attempt to scale Vietnam's tallest mountain.\nThe body of Aiden Webb, 22, from Norfolk, was found six days after he set off alone for the climb in June.\nGirlfriend Bluebell Baughan had begged him to get help via a series of text and Facebook messages after he got lost on Mount Fansipan, an inquest heard.\nCoroner Yvonne Blake recorded an open verdict into Mr Webb's death.\nA hearing in Norwich was told Ms Baughan, who was also staying in Vietnam at the time, was in contact by phone after Mr Webb slipped and became hurt.\nShe said Mr Webb got lost, slipped, then cut his bicep on a rock and hurt his knee, after being forced off the main trail due to a landslide.\nMore updates on this story and other Norfolk news\nMs Baughan said he initially refused her pleas to let her call the authorities for help.\nShe became \"very fraught\", she said, as they realised he had missed the last cable car and had to stay the night dressed just in shorts.\nIn a series of messages, Mr Webb told how he had \"got extremely lost\", then later told her: \"I am going to get pneumonia. I can't stop shivering.\"\nHe had also messaged to say: \"I've just had a huge rock land on my arm. I need stitches or glue.\"\nMr Webb later said he would set off back down the mountain, and in his last text at 06.18 asked Ms Baughan to finally raise the alarm, but her reply failed to get through. \nHis body was eventually found in a stream down a ravine. \nLocal police concluded he had drowned while unconscious after falling into water. \nA post-mortem examination was carried out in the UK after his parents asked for it not to be undertaken in Vietnam. \nBut Ms Blake said the medical cause of Mr Webb's death was \"unascertained as he was embalmed\".\nParents Simone Taylor and Trever Webb said in a written statement: \"Aiden was such a joy to be around.\n\"We're incredibly close as a family and feel privileged to have been his parents.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[0,1,2],"entityId":"Aiden Webb

Evans says U.S. economy doing 'quite well' but constrained","body":"CHICAGO The U.S. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Monday sketched a picture of a strengthening U.S. economy but one that's unlikely to break out of its current moderate growth path no matter what the Fed does or doesn't do. \nThe economy is doing \"quite well' and the labor market has been \"quite strong,\" Evans said, predicting economic growth of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent in the second half of this year.  \nBut, he said, there is an \"arithmetic\" constraint on potential U.S. growth rates, brought by lower productivity growth and slower labor force growth, that will keep potential growth to 1.75 percent to 2 percent in the longer run. \nTrying to get growth to rise higher, to say 4 percent, could result in inflation that's out of control, he said.\n\n\n\n (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu

responsible for putting up a poster mocking Syrian refugees in a parliament building.\nChi Onwurah, who represents Newcastle Central for Labour described the find as \"upsetting\".\nThe image was stuck to a cupboard in a communal kitchen in an MPs' building opposite the House of Commons.\nIt shows an elderly man, with the message: \"Just £3 from you could clothe and feed this 12-year-old Syrian child for a week\".\nMs Onwurah tweeted: \"Upset someone in Parliament thought it funny to display this in the communal kitchen over the weekend.\"\nThe shadow business and energy minister said she would be writing to the Serjeant at Arms of the House of Commons.\nShe said: \"If was in a building where the public goes it would have been offensive, but it could have been anybody.\n\"Here it must have been someone who has a parliamentary pass, who lives or works here.\n\"It was sellotaped onto a cupboard above the kitchen sink, not just left lying around for someone to have a chuckle over - it was definitely there to make a point.\n\"There are obviously challenges around migration in Europe with the war in Syria, it's so upsetting in itself, and frustrating in terms of what we can do.\n\"But these are human beings, not to be demonised, reduced to a meme.\n\"If people want to have a laugh or a joke they should do that in their own office, this is a working space.\n\"I do find it offensive, I don't want those attitudes in my working environment, and shouldn't have to see that when I go to make a cup of coffee, or

Inc's (T.N) Randall Stephenson for lunch at Time Warner Center in New York in late August, their meeting was supposed to be one of the catch-ups the two chief executives have had over the years.\nAnd it certainly started that way, with the two men chatting about the direction of the media, broadband and mobile telecommunications industries, according to accounts given by Stephenson and Bewkes as well as people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nStephenson and Bewkes discussed how Time Warner could reach more customers through AT&T's mobile network, and how that content could reinforce the loyalty of customers. Some of this could be achieved through closer ties and partnerships. \nBut then Stephenson showed his hand. He proposed an outright merger of the two companies, the biggest shakeup in the U.S. media landscape since U.S. telecommunications giant Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) takeover of media conglomerate NBC Universal in 2011.\n\"The more we talked about it, the more it fell into place, that there would be benefits that might be significant and might allow us to evolve the ecosystem faster,\" Bewkes told reporters on a conference call on Saturday. \nComcast's deal had greatly influenced Stephenson's thinking, spurring him to look for media and video acquisitions now that AT&T had the most video subscribers in the U.S. with 25 million. The media companies he first looked at buying, such as Starz (STRZA.O), which later merged with Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGF.N), and Scripps Network Interactive Inc (SNI.O), were too small for his liking. \nStephenson's problem was that the big media companies he deemed attractive were not easy targets. CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom (VIAB.O) were family controlled, while Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), with a $150 billion market capitalization, was too big. \nWhen Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) made a hostile acquisition approach to Time Warner in 2014, AT&T was awaiting regulatory approval on its deal to buy DirecTV, and couldn't pursue another large deal at the same time.\nDuring the year after the DirecTV acquisition closed in July 2015, AT&T had been thinking about going two ways; either a big international acquisition, or a big content deal. Before buying DirecTV, it had looked at combining its business with Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L) in Europe, according to the sources. But after buying two smaller wireless companies in Mexico, it couldn't find an international acquisition that suited its appetite. \nMore than a year after the DirecTV deal closed however, Stephenson felt he had the firepower to pursue Time Warner with an $85.4 billion cash-and-stock bid, this year's biggest attempted acquisition globally. \nThe deal was referred to within AT&T, in order to prevent leaks, as \"Project Bobtail\", whose aim was to acquire \"Rabbit\", the code name for Time Warner and perhaps a homage to Warner Bros' Bugs Bunny character. AT&T's code name was \"Lily\", the same as the customer service person who appears in their commercials.\n\"This thing just had what I would call gravity, and it seemed to move along on its own and we began negotiating out terms very quickly and it was a very natural process,\" Stephenson said on the media call.\n\nTRUSTED BANKERS    \n\nSoon after Stephenson proposed the combination to Bewkes, the companies called in their most trusted investment bank advisers.         \nAT&T decided to work with Woody Young, who had joined boutique bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP in January. He had worked on deals for AT&T for two decades, and most recently advised AT&T on its DirecTV deal in 2014, when he was at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).    \nTime Warner enlisted Allen & Company LLC banker Ketan Mehta, who had been Time Warner's banker for 12 years and had most recently defended Time Warner from Fox when he was at Citi in 2014. He had also helped defend Time Warner against activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006.    \nThe priority was to keep the deal secret from the media, a challenge given that Time Warner has large fiefdoms in the industry, with HBO in New York, Turner Broadcasting and its news unit CNN in Atlanta and Warner Bros in Los Angeles. \nTime Warner never reached out to other potential suitors during its talks with AT&T, according to the sources. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), widely speculated as another potential buyer for Time Warner, never showed a strong interest, the sources said, pointing out that after Fox's bid for Time Warner many other companies considered an acquisition but never made any offers.    \nLarge investment banks were brought on for financing in the week leading up to AT&T's and Time Warner's announcement on Saturday. When Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that the two companies had informal conversations about a merger without advisors, Stephenson and Bewkes had already shaken hands on the deal and their boards were close to approving it over the weekend.    To finalize the deal, Time Warner's board met in the offices of law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP's offices in New York and AT&T's board meeting was held at its headquarters in Dallas on Saturday.     \nThe deal was announced Saturday night, which caused Stephenson, an Oklahoma native, to miss a University of Oklahoma college football game. He had to ask a reporter for the score.\n\n (Reporting by Liana B.

teachers: 30% of 2010 intake quit within five years","body":"Almost a third of the new teachers who started jobs in English state schools in 2010 had left the sector five years later, ministers have confirmed.\nOf 24,100 state school teachers to qualify in 2010, 30% had quit by 2015, Schools Minister Nick Gibb revealed in a written parliamentary answer.\nThe Liberal Democrats say the figures are a \"damning record\" of Michael Gove's term as education secretary.\nThe government said teacher retention had been broadly stable for 20 years.\nThe figures were confirmed by Mr Gibb in a written parliamentary answer to a question from Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland. \nThey show that in November 2010 24,100 newly qualified teachers entered English state schools. \nAfter one year 87% were still there. \nThis fell to 82% after two years, 77% after three years, 73% after four years and 70% after five years. \nLiberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh said he blamed changes brought in by Mr Gove, who turned more than half of secondary schools into academies, reshaped the curriculum and rewrote the exam system. \n\"It is bad enough that dedicated teachers are being driven away from the profession they love, but this is also laying the foundations for a disastrous teaching shortage in years to come if we cannot train new teachers fast enough to replace the ones which leave,\" said Mr Pugh. \n\"The government must urgently work with the teaching community to address the many factors which are making teachers feel demoralised and under-valued; as well as reversing their devastating cuts to school budgets, which are putting increasing pressure on teachers and schools.\"\nTeacher supply expert Prof John Howson, who runs recruitment website TeachVac, says he believes the poor teacher retention rate has \"more to do with economics than politics\". \nHe said the last teacher recruitment crisis, at the turn of the millennium, was resolved by the Labour government \"taking the brakes off the advanced pay scale\" which meant young teachers received rapid pay rises.\nThe economic crisis saw a clampdown on public sector pay but it was not until the economy improved in 2012 that state school teachers found they could get better pay elsewhere, Prof Howson added. \nHe says they do not always leave teaching - some join private schools or teach overseas. \nHe suggests that as the secondary school-age population starts to rise there could be problems ahead, particularly in shortage subjects like physics or design technology \"where this is the fifth or sixth year when we haven't trained enough teachers\".\nThe Department for Education says more teachers are \"entering our classrooms than those choosing to leave or retire\".\nA spokesman said the annual average teacher salary in the UK was higher than the OECD average and higher than in many of Europe's high-performing education systems, like Finland, Norway or Sweden. \nHe added: \"We want every child to have access to great teachers that aren't weighed down with unnecessary workload so they have the time and freedom to do what they do best - inspire the next generation. We recognise teachers' concerns and are continuing to work with the sector to find constructive solutions to this issue.\"\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Percentage"],"matchingTokens":[3],"entityId":"30","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"30%","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":14,"endingPos":17},{"id":1,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[5],"entityId":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000-05:00","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2010","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":21,"endingPos":25},{"id":2,"type":["Duration"],"matchingTokens":[9,10],"entityId":"5","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"five

government securities, Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said on Monday.\nPowell said JPMorgan had publicly recognized the importance of not disrupting financial markets when it leaves the business.\n\"The timeline set for a gradual transition over the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations,\" Powell said in prepared remarks for a conference in New York on the structure of the U.S. Treasury market. \n\"However, if unexpected complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted,\" Powell said.\nCurrently, JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) are the only two companies that provide settlement services for U.S. government securities. \n\"Any disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial stability,\" Powell said, adding that the Bank of New York Mellon will continue to be held to higher standards of resilience given its systemic importance.\n\n (Reporting by Jason Lange in Washington;

investors weigh new growth, risks with Time Warner deal","body":"NEW YORK AT&T Inc shareholders who have profited for most of 2016 from owning a major telecommunications provider with a strong dividend yield are now tied to a controversial media acquisition that comes with new growth potential but also fresh risks.\nAT&T shareholders so far have panned the $85 billion cash-and-stock purchase of Time Warner unveiled over the weekend.\nSince word of the acquisition first leaked on Thursday, AT&T shares have fallen 6.4 percent, their largest three-day drop since January 2009. On Monday, the shares fell 1.7 percent to close at $36.86.\nPrior to the news, the stock had climbed more than 14 percent this year, outperforming a 5 percent gain for the S&P 500 index. Including dividends, the stock had returned 20 percent.\nAnalysts said AT&T shares would fluctuate based on the outlook for the deal, which faces a potentially hostile regulatory review made more uncertain by the upcoming U.S. elections.\n\"If you wanted to be invested in a wireless company or you wanted to play wireless as a theme or broadband as a theme, this to some degree takes away from that,\" said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co.\n\"There are clearly a lot of people who are selling the stock because this no longer meets the requirements to which they thought they were buying into before today,\" Synesael said.\nMore than 80 million AT&T shares changed hands on Friday and 100 million on Monday. This was over three times the average daily volume of the past 50 days.\nAnalysts also expressed caution about the debt that AT&T would take on for the deal.\n\"Investors are concerned that (the leverage) makes AT&T a much riskier security than it has been in the past,\" said Craig Moffett, analyst at Moffett Nathanson. \"For a stock that has traditionally been viewed as a defensive, it is now much more exposed to both cyclical and secular pressures.\"\nAny increased leverage could threaten AT&T's 5 percent dividend yield.\nBut the company has said that the acquisition would improve its dividend coverage, in addition to adding cable TV channels CNN and HBO, as well as other media assets.\nMacquarie Capital analyst Amy Yong said the shares could repeat Comcast's solid performance after it agreed to buy NBC Universal in 2009, although the current regulatory environment was more unsettled.\n\"I think it's going to be very similar,\" Yong said. \"When you get the first sign of regulatory approval, I think the stock will obviously reflect that.\"\n\n (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Richard Chang)\n","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Organisation","Company"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"AT&T","freebaseTypes":["/internet/website_owner","/organization/organization","/business/business_operation","/computer/software_developer","/business/employer","/business/sponsor","/amusement_parks/ride_theme","/business/consumer_company","/business/issuer","/venture_capital/venture_investor","/computer/operating_system_developer","/cvg/cvg_publisher","/award/award_winner","/award/ranked_item","/organization/organization_partnership","/exhibitions/exhibition_sponsor","/book/book_subject"],"confidenceScore":2.192,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T","matchedText":"AT&T","freebaseId":"/m/08z129","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"AT&T","startingPos":0,"endingPos":4,"wikidataId":"Q35476"},{"id":1,"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"Investor","freebaseTypes":["/book/book_subject","/fictional_universe/character_occupation","/people/profession"],"confidenceScore":1.247,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor","matchedText":"investors","freebaseId":"/m/025sppp","relevanceScore":0.1217,"entityEnglishId":"Investor","startingPos":5,"endingPos":14,"wikidataId":"Q557880"},{"id":2,"type":["Agent","Organisation","Company"],"matchingTokens":[8,9],"entityId":"Time

conglomerate HNA Group said on Monday it would buy about 25 percent of hotel operator and manager Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc from biggest shareholder Blackstone Group LP for $6.5 billion.\nShares of Hilton, whose brands include Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Curio and Double Tree as well as Hilton, rose as much as 3.71 percent to $23.76 in early trading.\nHNA Group will buy the stake for $26.25 per share, representing a premium of 14.6 percent to Hilton's closing price on Friday and valuing the hotel company at about $26 billion.\nBlackstone took Hilton private in 2007 for $26.7 billion, including debt. In 2013, the private equity firm listed the company in the biggest-ever hotel IPO. (reut.rs/2exryfE)\nThis is HNA Group's second investment in the U.S. hospitality industry this year. \nThe company agreed in April to buy Carlson Hotels Inc, the owner of the Radisson hotel chain, including its 51.3 percent majority stake in Rezidor Hotel Group AB, for an undisclosed sum.\nChinese companies have been splurging on foreign acquisitions to sidestep slowing growth at home.\nOverseas mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies have touched a record $181 billion so far this year, about 70 percent more than the whole of last year.\nHNA Group's Avolon Holdings agreed earlier this month to buy CIT Group's aircraft leasing assets worth $10 billion in a deal that will create the world's third-largest lessor.\nHowever, Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance Group Co, which bought the iconic Waldorf Astoria in New York in 2015, abandoned its pursuit of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide following a bidding war with Marriott International Inc.\nMarriott completed the acquisition of Starwood in September to create the world's biggest hotel chain. (reut.rs/2exdDpz)\nHNA Group said on Monday it will also own a stake of about 25 percent in Hilton's real estate and timeshare businesses, following their expected separation by the end of 2016. \nThe deal will allow the HNA Group to appoint two directors to Hilton's board, raising its size to 10. \nBlackstone will continue to have two seats on Hilton's board, including Jonathan Gray who will remain as chairman.\nEvercore was the financial adviser to Hilton, while JPMorgan advised HNA.\nUp to Friday's close, Hilton's stock had risen about 7 percent this year, compared with the 1.5 percent decline in the Dow Jones U.S. Travel & Leisure index.\n\n (Reporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Sriraj
