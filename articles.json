[{"title":"Diabetes: Tenth of adults at risk of disease by 2035","body":"Health experts are warning that one in 10 adults in the UK will be at risk of developing diabetes by 2035.For the first time, Public Health England forecasts the number of people with the disease could top five million if obesity rates continue to increase.About 90% of patients have type 2 diabetes, which is linked to being overweight.A separate analysis says the cost of treating the UK's \"diabetes epidemic\" could soar to 17% of the NHS budget.Experts are warning the burden of treating diabetes, especially new cases of type 2, could bankrupt the NHS.Statisticians at Public Health England have published a new forecast for the number of people who will develop diabetes in the coming years. Their analysis includes type one, which is an auto-immune disease and accounts for about 10% of cases in the UK.But the remaining 90% have type 2, which can be affected by where you come from and your family history, but in most cases is associated with being overweight.In 2015, there were around 3.8 million people living with diabetes in England alone. If obesity rates remain stable, Public Health England predicts that by 2035 that figure could have leapt to 4.9 million.But if obesity rates increase by 3% every five years, an extra 263,000 people will have developed diabetes by 2035, putting the overall figure at more than five million.  Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, says there are clear implications of what he calls a \"diabetes epidemic\".\"As things stand we are certainly looking at a crisis in diabetes which threatens to bankrupt the NHS if we continue with these current trends.\"I believe we're facing a crisis and we really need concerted action right across society for us to fund more research, provide best possible care and crucially prevent so many cases of type 2 in the future.\"At the same time, an analysis of the costs of treating complications associated with diabetes shows how they could spiral out of control. The York Health Economics Consortium says that across the UK, the NHS currently spends about 10% of its entire budget on diabetic care.But researchers predict that figure could rise to 17% if rates continue to grow.Nick Hex is the economist who calculated the new figures.\"There is a fixed amount of money for the NHS so clearly if one disease area like diabetes is taking up more, a considerable amount of that cost, then there is less money to spend on cancer.\"So it's really important policymakers think about ways costs can be mitigated over next few years because there won't be enough to go round.\"Those comments are echoed by Professor Jonathan Valabhji, the national clinical director for obesity and diabetes for NHS England.\"We need to stem the tide, otherwise we could see crisis and there are issues of sustainability for the NHS if we do nothing differently.\" Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar to become too high.

tells May she's 'not bluffing' over referendum","body":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned Theresa May she is not \"bluffing\" over her promise to hold an independence referendum if Scotland's vote against Brexit is \"not respected\".After talks in Downing Street, she said she was not prepared to see \"Scotland driven off a hard Brexit cliff-edge\".She and the first ministers of Wales and Northern Ireland demanded to be fully consulted on EU negotiations.But Downing Street said it was vital not to \"undermine\" the UK's position.The Scottish and Welsh leaders want the devolved legislatures and Parliament all to vote on the UK's approach when formal talks with the European Union about Brexit begin.The issue was discussed as the joint ministerial committee - bringing together the prime minister, Ms Sturgeon, Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness - met for the first time since 2014.Afterwards, Mrs May said: \"Working together, the nations of the United Kingdom will make a success of leaving the European Union - and we will further strengthen our own unique and enduring union as we do so.\"The great union between us has been the cornerstone of our prosperity in the past - and it is absolutely vital to our success in the future.\"The country is facing a negotiation of tremendous importance and it is imperative that the devolved administrations play their part in making it work.\"Downing Street is proposing that Brexit Secretary David Davis chair a new forum, bringing together representatives from the devolved nations before the prime minister triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - formally starting the two-year Brexit process - by the end of March next year.But Mr Jones and Ms Sturgeon have both said Article 50 should not be invoked until there is an agreed approach to negotiations with the EU.The two leaders have stressed their desire to see continued participation in the European single market - a situation that could be at risk if the UK pursued a so-called \"hard\" approach to Brexit. Ms Sturgeon appeared less happy than the prime minister about the way the Downing Street meeting had gone, saying she had received \"no more information or detail\" about the UK negotiating position, hearing only \"warm words\" from the UK government.She added: \"I'm not going to stand by and watch Scotland driven off a hard Brexit cliff-edge. Scotland's vote to stay has to be respected.\"In 2014, Scottish voters decided by 55.3% to 44.7% against independence from the UK and Ms Sturgeon has raised the possibility of another vote.She said: \"There's not a bit of what I'm doing just now that's bluffing or game-playing. This is not a game of chicken. It's not a game at all.\"Ms Sturgeon told reporters: \"If all we get from the negotiations is a door slammed in our face, Scotland should be able to chose a better option.\"Ms Foster, also speaking in Downing Street after the meeting, said: \"It's important that we are involved in the heart of [the Brexit negotiation] process.\"BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May had \"delivered a fairly bold 'Non'\" to demands for devolved legislatures to have a greater say in Brexit. She did not want \"separate deals in separate parts of the UK\" because this risked \"confusing\" issues and \"undermining her negotiating strategy\", he added. But, following Ms Sturgeon's call for a second referendum, Mrs May realised what an \"awfully big\" situation the UK faced, Norman Smith said, adding: \"If she gets it wrong, she risks being the prime minister who took Britain out of the EU but also risks breaking up the United Kingdom.\"The talks came as a think tank warned the UK faced a \"full-blown constitutional crisis\" unless all nations of the UK agreed on \"core planks\" of the government's approach to Brexit. The Institute for Government warned imposing a settlement on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland might be legally possible but \"if it proves impossible to find consensus... the result may be a serious breakdown in relations between the four governments (and nations) of the UK\".","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[0],"entityId":"Sturgeon","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Sturgeon","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":0,"endingPos":8},{"id":1,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[2],"entityId":"2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"May","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":15,"endingPos":18}],"body_entities":[{"id":0,"matchingTokens":[0,1],"entityId":"First

award over claims she lied about flying solo on an 8,000-mile trip. Tracey Curtis-Taylor, 54, flew from Cape Town to Goodwood in West Sussex in 2013 in a open cockpit Boeing Stearman.She said she had intended to make the journey in the biplane flying solo, but denied she had made \"false assertions\".Ms Curtis-Taylor said: \"A combination of elements resulted in fundamental changes being made to the nature of that expedition.\"The Light Aircraft Association (LAA) has stripped Ms Curtis-Taylor of the Bill Woodhams trophy awarded for navigation.An spokesman for the association said a motion to \"rescind an award of the Bill Woodhams Trophy, made in 2014\" had been carried at the association's annual general meeting on Saturday. Ms Curtis-Taylor said: \"I began with the intention of trying to fly the Africa flight solo but a combination of elements resulted in fundamental changes being made to the nature of that expedition.\"I have never made false assertions about the nature of my flights.\"She said several people had flown with her on multiple legs between Cape Town and the UK, including her engineer Ewald Gritsch. Mr Gritsch said his role was the \"reassembly of the airplane in Cape Town and the technical support during the expedition\".He said: \"I had to take over the flight planning across Africa at short notice, which was done together with the professional African pilots in our team and two major aviation companies.\"Sam Rutherford, who was the logistics manager on the flight, was in a plane flying behind Ms Curtis-Taylor's biplane. He said: \"It's a great shame personally for Tracey, but the right decision for the LAA.\"You are meant to be the only human being in an aircraft.\"","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[2,3],"entityId":"Tracey

Webb Vietnam death: Climber 'suddenly lost contact'","body":"A backpacker has described the moment she lost contact with her rock climber boyfriend - who died during an attempt to scale Vietnam's tallest mountain.The body of Aiden Webb, 22, from Norfolk, was found six days after he set off alone for the climb in June.Girlfriend Bluebell Baughan had begged him to get help via a series of text and Facebook messages after he got lost on Mount Fansipan, an inquest heard.Coroner Yvonne Blake recorded an open verdict into Mr Webb's death.A hearing in Norwich was told Ms Baughan, who was also staying in Vietnam at the time, was in contact by phone after Mr Webb slipped and became hurt.She said Mr Webb got lost, slipped, then cut his bicep on a rock and hurt his knee, after being forced off the main trail due to a landslide.More updates on this story and other Norfolk newsMs Baughan said he initially refused her pleas to let her call the authorities for help.She became \"very fraught\", she said, as they realised he had missed the last cable car and had to stay the night dressed just in shorts.In a series of messages, Mr Webb told how he had \"got extremely lost\", then later told her: \"I am going to get pneumonia. I can't stop shivering.\"He had also messaged to say: \"I've just had a huge rock land on my arm. I need stitches or glue.\"Mr Webb later said he would set off back down the mountain, and in his last text at 06.18 asked Ms Baughan to finally raise the alarm, but her reply failed to get through. His body was eventually found in a stream down a ravine. Local police concluded he had drowned while unconscious after falling into water. A post-mortem examination was carried out in the UK after his parents asked for it not to be undertaken in Vietnam. But Ms Blake said the medical cause of Mr Webb's death was \"unascertained as he was embalmed\".Parents Simone Taylor and Trever Webb said in a written statement: \"Aiden was such a joy to be around.\"We're incredibly close as a family and feel privileged to have been his parents.\"","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[0,1,2],"entityId":"Aiden Webb

 \n\n  The Donald Trump In These Allegations Is Not The Complete Monster I Married\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"Over the last few days, a number of women have come forward to accuse my husband, presidential nominee Donald Trump, of sexually assaulting them. As the candidate’s wife, I know him better than anyone, and I want to assure voters that the Donald Trump in these allegations is not the complete monster I married.Believe me, the misogynistic, lying, pathologically self-centered Donald I know is nothing like the one these women describe.I’ve been married to Donald Trump for more than 10 years now, and in all the times I’ve seen him treat other human beings as nothing more than objects for his own gratification, I’ve never seen him do the things he is currently being accused of.I realize my husband has his faults. He can be impulsive, short-tempered, cruel, arrogant, bigoted, thin-skinned, manipulative, hateful, defensive, intolerant, deluded, vindictive, greedy, perverted, narcissistic, dishonest, threatening, megalomaniacal, and psychopathic. But show me an irredeemably horrible, self-obsessed person who isn’t. What I have never personally seen him do, though, in all the years I’ve listened to him say demeaning and graphically sexual things about women, is touch someone without their consent.That is simply not the vicious, racist, dangerously unstable sociopath I wake up next to every morning.Now, am I by Donald’s side 24 hours a day? Of course not. But based on what I’ve experienced of him as a disgusting, reprehensible egomaniac who sees only himself and denies the humanity of others, it’s hard for me to imagine him doing the things these women accuse him of. Scapegoat racial minorities? Yes. Make veiled suggestions that someone should assassinate his opponent? Sure. Degrade and humiliate women at every opportunity in his personal and professional life? Of course. But assault? I just can’t see the loathsome demon I married doing something like that.In the coming days and weeks, the media is going to try to portray my husband as a lecherous, chauvinistic serial abuser. But what they don’t understand is that deep down inside, he’s just a prurient, sexist predator—one who doesn’t let anything get between him and the satisfaction of his immediate desires—and that’s it! Nothing more, nothing less.I know people will say that I’m deluding myself. That I can’t read the writing on the wall. That the only way I can be psychologically comfortable continuing to live alongside such a heartless, dangerous, malignant individual is by blindly convincing myself that he could never have committed the crimes that he’s been accused of and, indeed, bragged about on tape. All I can say is that when I see him in the morning before he goes to work and at night when he returns home, Donald is simply a human horror show who has never once given a moment of thought to the hopes, dreams, struggles, or circumstances of anyone else in existence. That’s my Donald.So before you rush to judgment, please, forget what the media is telling you for a moment, and try to see my husband the way I do: as a repugnant, repulsive cancer of a person who makes our world a crueler, more hateful place by his very existence.That’s the real Donald Trump.","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Agent","Person"],"matchingTokens":[1,2],"entityId":"Donald

At This Also\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"The 2016 presidential race is unlike any we’ve seen before. Americans are as fed up as they’ve ever been with establishment politics, the nation is confronted with the two least popular major-party nominees in modern history, and people everywhere seem hungry for a change to the status quo. As a result, there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here for a third-party candidate to present a transformative new vision for our nation and win the support of voters all across the country. And frankly, I am just as disappointed as you are to realize I am in no way qualified to do that.Look, I get it. I really do. I wish I were better at this too.What can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.Third-party candidates usually get pushed to the sidelines, where they compete for a tiny fraction of the electorate, but this year, with so many voters deeply dissatisfied with the Republican and Democratic nominees, we’re getting far more attention. As it turns out, though, being a high-profile presidential candidate requires you to do a lot of stuff you don’t have to do when you’re only pulling in 1 percent of the vote, like know all about foreign affairs and domestic policy.The appearances on national television, the greater publicity given to my platform and qualifications, the chance to connect with a wider variety of voters—these are all things that would come as welcome challenges to a knowledgeable and competent candidate. But as you can probably tell by now, I am simply not up to the task. Not even close.What can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.I do think that I did a pretty good job as the Libertarian Party nominee last time. In 2012, hardly anyone was listening to what I had to say, so it’s not like I had to worry about being asked to explain my views on international relations or the feasibility of my tax policy or anything like that. This time around, we’ve been polling a lot better—which is great!—but it also means that I’ve had to field questions on all kinds of subjects I just don’t have any clue about. It’s actually been pretty embarrassing.Like a lot of you, I didn’t expect this election season to turn out the way it has. When we started out with more than 20 candidates competing for the Democratic and Republican nominations, who would have guessed that we’d end up with two nominees who are disliked and distrusted by a majority of Americans? I figured that at this point in the year, I’d be doing the typical third-party thing: you know, scraping together a couple million votes from independents and people on the ideological fringe. Instead, tens of millions of people are taking a serious look at my candidacy, which is something I clearly was not capable of dealing with. Whoops.It’s frustrating, because what we have here is a great chance to show voters they have options besides the Democratic and Republican parties, which keep offering the same tired ideas we’ve tried a hundred times before. But at the same time, we have me, sitting there for yet another interview where I’m asked very basic questions about current events and blanking like an idiot. I’m not just letting myself down—I’m letting down everyone who’s looking for a credible alternative to two deeply flawed major-party nominees.It sucks! I don’t know what else to tell you.What makes it really disappointing is that I truly believe libertarianism has valuable ideas to contribute to America’s political discourse. And just in general, I think it would be great to have at least one viable choice out there besides the two major parties, which on many issues, like corporate influence and federal spending, aren’t all that different. But boy oh boy, am I ever doing a shitty job of communicating all that. Voters deserve to hear about these policies from someone who can intelligently and persuasively represent them. But instead you’ve got me. Sorry.Even worse is that it’s probably going to be decades before any third-party candidate has a chance like this again. The two leading candidates supported a failed war that destabilized the Middle East, backed a criminal justice system that preys on racial minorities, and come with decades’ worth of personal baggage. What more could I have asked for? This is probably the best shot we’re ever going to get, and here I am wasting it for everyone.Oh well, at least I’m not blowing it as badly as Jill Stein.","body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":4,"endingPos":8},{"id":1,"type":["Place"],"matchingTokens":[12],"entityId":"Americans","freebaseTypes":["/location/location"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Americans","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":60,"endingPos":69},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[38,39],"entityId":"Modern

offenders?","body":"A 13-year-old boy has been sentenced to four years in custody for the rape of a nine-year-old boy and sexual assault of two others when he was 11. How does the system deal with such young sexual offenders and their victims?Put yourself in the position of a child counsellor who has been assigned the task of meeting a young person who has been convicted of committing sexual abuse crimes so grave they are being held in a secure unit.Is this young person a monster with nothing to redeem them? Or a vulnerable child with their own problems to be fixed?That is the kind of scenario that Professor Simon Hackett has often found himself in. He is an expert in child protection and acts as chairman for the National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers (Nota).He says of the children convicted of sex crimes:  \"We sometimes have this image of them as demons, paedophiles. We have to deal with those things that they have done and protect others.\"But, by and large, these are vulnerable and abused children.\"I always used to feel a sense of anxiety on sitting down in a room with the child or young person. \"But, when I met them, I was often struck by how normal they seemed. They need our help for the horrific things they have done, but we shouldn't forget that they are, first and foremost, children.\"The kind of issues Prof Hackett has faced are highlighted by the case of a Blackpool boy sentenced in Preston on Friday. The boy admitted multiple rapes of a nine-year-old boy and sexual touching of two boys aged seven and 11.The age of the perpetrator and his victims is strikingly young. But there are only a few such convictions for rape or sexual assault each year in the UK:In reality, however, these convictions are a tiny fraction of the actual number of incidents. Children's charity the NSPCC says about a third of sexual abuse is committed by minors.In many instances children are not prosecuted - either because the case results in a caution, or the abuser is below the age of criminal responsibility (10 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; 12 in Scotland). \"Only a small proportion are convicted,\" says Prof Hackett, \"but a significant amount of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by children and this also includes those under the age of 10\".His research has found the average age of child sex abusers is dropping, perhaps partly because the teachers, social workers, police - the professionals working in child protection - are better at detecting it.His 2013 study of 700 cases of children referred to professionals because of their sexually abusive behaviour found one third were aged 13 or under; more than 100 were 11 or under.The youngest studied was four years old. Prof Hackett says: \"Half of the group had themselves been sexually abused, more than half were physically abused or neglected.In the Blackpool case, the court heard the boy was a \"high\" risk for committing further offences. So, how does the criminal justice system proceed?The NSPCC has developed a national framework to guide local areas as they work with children who display harmful sexual behaviour (HSM). It runs Turn the Page, a service providing therapy for children, and family support. Work takes place in stages.A first step is to try to ensure the offender and the victim are safe - from reoffending or from the community. Adults working with the children set out a safety plan and monitor their behaviour.They assess the offence - was it normal behaviour, or not?  A single or multiple incident? Was there consent, or violence?Via social workers and the justice system there may be help at home for low level offences. In the most serious cases, removal and custody to a foster placement or a secure unit.Offenders have therapy, from a psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker, be that general help or specialist therapists working with highly deviant offenders. Prof Hackett has sat down to counsel child offenders many times, often in secure units. He explains to them why their behaviour is harmful to other people, so they realise the impact. Abusers are taught to manage risks and triggers for their behaviour.How long the therapy continues varies. There might be a court order, for a given period of time; short doses of three to six months; or treatment over several years. Despite cases like the one in Blackpool, he says, there is \"a hopeful message\" for families whose children have a sexual behaviour problem.In his study of 69 children followed up in adulthood \"the vast majority were not offending sexually\" a result borne out by other international studies. Support and the passage of time means the majority grow up and out of the behaviour. It is a small proportion who go on to be prolific sex offenders.","body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Duration"],"matchingTokens":[7,8],"entityId":"4","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"four

over an alleged killing.The ex-quiz show panellist, 46, from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is accused of manslaughter, murder, assault and battery in Amsterdam in 1988.He was detained under a European arrest warrant at Heathrow Airport last month.Dutch authorities reportedly abandoned a bid to bring him to the Netherlands.Mr de Mooi, whose real name is Joseph Connagh, was said to be \"very pleased\".His manager said in a statement: \"CJ is obviously very pleased with the result of today's hearing and will continue to co-operate with the Dutch authorities until this matter is finally concluded.\"He would like to thank the tens of thousands of people who have contacted him via social media and in person, for their lovely words and support during this traumatic time for him.\"Mr de Mooi's autobiography, published last year, described an incident in which he said he may have killed a man while he lived on the streets.He said he punched a man who approached him with a knife before throwing him into a canal in 1988.In his book, he wrote: \"He caught me on the wrong day and I just snapped. I fully suspect I killed him. I've no idea what happened to him.\"Mr de Mooi, originally from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, adopted the name de Mooi when modelling.

Observer” section of Donald Trump’s campaign website reportedly trains supporters to spot any suspicious skin colors they may see on Election Day, sources confirmed this week. “Keep an eye out for any of the skin tones appearing on the list below, none of which are allowable on November 8,” read the webpage in part, reminding volunteers that watching out for certain suspect and disreputable complexions was the only way to ensure the Republican nominee had a fair shot at winning the election. “Be on the lookout for these two shades in particular, as they have historically proven to cause significant trouble. And remember that whenever you spot a dubious-looking skin pigmentation at your polling place, immediately confront the problem head-on.” The site further stated that should a volunteer happen to notice a significantly high number of suspicious skin colors at their precinct, they should call their local Trump field office immediately so the campaign could formally contest the polling location’s results.","title_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":41,"endingPos":45},{"id":1,"type":["Person"],"matchingTokens":[7],"entityId":"Trump","freebaseTypes":["/people/person"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Trump","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":111,"endingPos":116},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[10,11],"entityId":"Scrutineer","confidenceScore":1.544,"wikiLink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrutineer","matchedText":"Poll

enrolled in professor Michael Rosenthal's Philosophy 101 course at Dartmouth College, that guy, Darrin Floen, the one who sits at the back of the class and acts like he's Aristotle, seriously needs to shut the fuck up.His fellow students describe Floen's frequent comments as eager, interested, and incredibly annoying.\"He thinks he knows about philosophy,\" freshman Duane Herring said. \"But I hate his voice, and I hate the way he only half raises his hand, like he's so laid back. We're discussing ethics in a couple weeks, but I don't know if I can wait that long before deciding if it's morally wrong to pound his face in.\"\"Today he was going on and on about how Plato's cave shadows themselves represent the ideal foundation of Western philosophical thought,\" said freshman Julia Wald moments after class let out Monday. \"I have no idea what Plato's ideal reality is, but I bet it doesn't include know-it-all little shits.\"Wald added: \"If he uses the word  'dialectical' one more time, I'm going to shove my copy of The Republic down his throat.\"Although he demonstrated a familiarity with Peter Singer's view on famine relief during a discussion of John Locke's theory of property, Floen is reportedly unfamiliar with the theory of cramming it for a change and giving someone else a chance to speak.\"Just last week Professor Rosenthal was talking about Russell's Paradox, and that jackass starts going off: 'But what about Heraclitus' aphorism: Everything flows, nothing stands still?'\" classmate James Luers said. \"At first I was like, 'That's totally irrelevant,' but then I was like, 'Well, actually, it does apply to the nonstop flapping of your trap.'\"Among the 40 students who regularly attend Philosophy 101, the one who has endured the most suffering is freshman William Deekes. \"Some people know Darrin as just 'that guy in philosophy class who needs to shut the hell up,'\" Deekes said. \"I, however, also know him as 'the douche in African history who seriously needs to chill' and 'the a-hole in environmental sciences who could really use a girlfriend.'\"\"I enrolled in this course because I was fascinated by the question of God,\" said sophomore Miriam Blank. \"After spending six hours a week in the same room as that unbearable windbag, I think I have my answer. Life is as long as it is cruel.\"The outspoken student has not gone unremarked by the course's professor.\"Mr. Floen is a valuable contributor to our in-class discussions,\" Rosenthal said. \"His

 \n\n  Look, I Wish I Were Better At This Also\n\n\n  \n\n  \n","body":"The 2016 presidential race is unlike any we’ve seen before. Americans are as fed up as they’ve ever been with establishment politics, the nation is confronted with the two least popular major-party nominees in modern history, and people everywhere seem hungry for a change to the status quo. As a result, there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here for a third-party candidate to present a transformative new vision for our nation and win the support of voters all across the country. And frankly, I am just as disappointed as you are to realize I am in no way qualified to do that.Look, I get it. I really do. I wish I were better at this too.What can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.Third-party candidates usually get pushed to the sidelines, where they compete for a tiny fraction of the electorate, but this year, with so many voters deeply dissatisfied with the Republican and Democratic nominees, we’re getting far more attention. As it turns out, though, being a high-profile presidential candidate requires you to do a lot of stuff you don’t have to do when you’re only pulling in 1 percent of the vote, like know all about foreign affairs and domestic policy.The appearances on national television, the greater publicity given to my platform and qualifications, the chance to connect with a wider variety of voters—these are all things that would come as welcome challenges to a knowledgeable and competent candidate. But as you can probably tell by now, I am simply not up to the task. Not even close.What can I say? I’m trying my best, but I’m just drowning out here.I do think that I did a pretty good job as the Libertarian Party nominee last time. In 2012, hardly anyone was listening to what I had to say, so it’s not like I had to worry about being asked to explain my views on international relations or the feasibility of my tax policy or anything like that. This time around, we’ve been polling a lot better—which is great!—but it also means that I’ve had to field questions on all kinds of subjects I just don’t have any clue about. It’s actually been pretty embarrassing.Like a lot of you, I didn’t expect this election season to turn out the way it has. When we started out with more than 20 candidates competing for the Democratic and Republican nominations, who would have guessed that we’d end up with two nominees who are disliked and distrusted by a majority of Americans? I figured that at this point in the year, I’d be doing the typical third-party thing: you know, scraping together a couple million votes from independents and people on the ideological fringe. Instead, tens of millions of people are taking a serious look at my candidacy, which is something I clearly was not capable of dealing with. Whoops.It’s frustrating, because what we have here is a great chance to show voters they have options besides the Democratic and Republican parties, which keep offering the same tired ideas we’ve tried a hundred times before. But at the same time, we have me, sitting there for yet another interview where I’m asked very basic questions about current events and blanking like an idiot. I’m not just letting myself down—I’m letting down everyone who’s looking for a credible alternative to two deeply flawed major-party nominees.It sucks! I don’t know what else to tell you.What makes it really disappointing is that I truly believe libertarianism has valuable ideas to contribute to America’s political discourse. And just in general, I think it would be great to have at least one viable choice out there besides the two major parties, which on many issues, like corporate influence and federal spending, aren’t all that different. But boy oh boy, am I ever doing a shitty job of communicating all that. Voters deserve to hear about these policies from someone who can intelligently and persuasively represent them. But instead you’ve got me. Sorry.Even worse is that it’s probably going to be decades before any third-party candidate has a chance like this again. The two leading candidates supported a failed war that destabilized the Middle East, backed a criminal justice system that preys on racial minorities, and come with decades’ worth of personal baggage. What more could I have asked for? This is probably the best shot we’re ever going to get, and here I am wasting it for everyone.Oh well, at least I’m not blowing it as badly as Jill Stein.","body_entities":[{"id":0,"type":["Time"],"matchingTokens":[1],"entityId":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"2016","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":4,"endingPos":8},{"id":1,"type":["Place"],"matchingTokens":[12],"entityId":"Americans","freebaseTypes":["/location/location"],"confidenceScore":0.5,"wikiLink":"","matchedText":"Americans","relevanceScore":0,"entityEnglishId":"","startingPos":60,"endingPos":69},{"id":2,"matchingTokens":[38,39],"entityId":"Modern

Street, Cushing draw limit loss","body":"NEW YORK Oil prices fell on Monday after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an OPEC production cut, though prices drew some support from a rally in Wall Street shares and a draw in crude inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced plans last month to cut output to boost prices, but  has not yet given details on how it will reach the target. Members meet in Vienna on Nov. 30. Iraqi oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said on Sunday the country, second largest producer in OPEC, wanted to be exempt from output curbs as it needed more money to fight Islamic State militants.\"This just casts one more spotlight onto potential uncertainty ahead of this meeting,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at energy data provider ClipperData.Brent, the international benchmark for crude LCOc1, was down 60 cents at $51.18 a barrel by 11:53 a.m. EDT (1553 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 was down 62 cents at $50.24.Losses were limited as a flurry of deal activity boosted stock prices on Wall Street and as data by energy monitoring firm Genscape showed a draw of about 1.0 million barrels of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for WTI during the week to Oct. 21. [.N]Comments from Iran's deputy oil minister Amir Hossein Zamaninia also helped limit losses in oil earlier.Zamaninia said Tehran would encourage other OPEC members to join an output freeze, adding that $55-$60 a barrel was a fair price to bring stability to the market. Oil was trading above $100 a barrel in mid-2014 before a crude glut forced it lower.     Russia, the world's No. 3 oil producer which is not a part of OPEC, was confident of reaching a deal with the group to support the market, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who has been holding talks with Saudi and other OPEC officials.Saudi Arabia is the world's No. 2 oil producer and largest oil exporter. No. 1 oil producer the United States, responsible for much of the supply glut of the past two years, will not be a party to any agreement between producer countries.\"Ongoing discussions between Saudi Arabia and Russia haven't offered much in the way of definition and we would be surprised by any clarity until the official OPEC talks at the end of next month,\" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil markets consultancy Ritterbusch & Associates.

offering an upgrade program option to Galaxy Note 7 customers in South Korea who trade in their recalled device for a Galaxy S7 phone, marking its latest attempt to retain customers.In a statement on Monday, Samsung said customers who trade in their Note 7 phone for either a flat-screen or curved-screen version of the Galaxy S7 can trade up for a Galaxy S8 or Note 8 smartphone launching next year through an upgrade program.The world's top smartphone maker permanently ended Note 7 sales due to continued reports of fire from the flagship device. In addition to offering refunds or exchanges for a Galaxy S7 smartphone, Samsung has already offered financial incentives amounting to 100,000 won ($88.39) to affected customers in South Korea.Users in the upgrade program will need to pay only half the price of a Galaxy S7 device, rather than the full amount, before exchanging to the S8 or the Note 8, Samsung said.In offering the Note 8 upgrade option, Samsung indirectly reinforced previous statements that the Note series will not be discontinued. The company said the availability of such a program in other markets will be dependent on the situation in each country. It did not elaborate. Samsung has stepped up marketing and promotion for its Galaxy S smartphones to try to make up for some of the lost sales. The Note 7's collapse is already costing Samsung $5.4  billion won in operating profit between the third quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2017.Some analysts say Samsung will need to offer incentives to affected customers as part of their efforts to limit long-term damage to its brand and reputation from the Note 7's failure.The South Korean firm is facing legal challenges from customers, as well. Harvest Law, a domestic law firm, said on Monday one of its lawyers, Peter Young-yeel Ko, and 526 others have filed a lawsuit in a South Korean court against Samsung seeking compensation of 500,000 won ($442.61) per person. Samsung did not immediately comment on the suit. The firm is also facing a proposed class action lawsuit from three Galaxy Note 7 customers in the United States.

Prime Minister Theresa May tried to persuade the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Monday to work with her government on a common Brexit negotiating position, but the Scottish leader dismissed the meeting as \"deeply frustrating\".May says that while the devolved governments of the UK's three smaller nations should give their views on what the terms of Brexit should be, they must not undermine the UK's strategy by seeking separate settlements with the EU.\"I don't know what the UK's negotiating position is because they can't tell us,\" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said after talks at May's Downing Street office.\"I can't undermine something that doesn't exist, it doesn't appear to me at the moment that there is a UK negotiating strategy,\" she told Sky News television.While England and Wales voted for Brexit in a June referendum, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, setting the devolved governments in Edinburgh and Belfast on a collision course with the UK's central government in London.This could lead to a constitutional crisis, and potentially to Scottish independence and renewed political tensions in Northern Ireland.At the meeting with Sturgeon and the Welsh and Northern Irish leaders, May proposed setting up a new body to give the three devolved governments, which have varying degrees of autonomy from London, a formal avenue to express their views.\"Working together, the nations of the United Kingdom will make a success of leaving the European Union -- and we will further strengthen our unique and enduring union as we do so,\" May said in a statement after the talks.But Sturgeon struck a very different tone as she emerged.\"What I'm not prepared to do ... is stand back and watch Scotland driven off a hard Brexit cliff edge because the consequences in lost jobs, lost investment and lower living standards are too serious,\" she said.CONFLICTING PRIORITIESThe British government, which has promised to kick off formal divorce talks with the EU before the end of March, has said it will negotiate a bespoke deal on behalf of the whole United Kingdom with the bloc's other 27 members.Sturgeon said she would make specific proposals over the next few weeks to keep Scotland in the single market even if the rest of the UK left, and that May had said she was prepared to listen to options.\"So far those words are not matched by substance or actions and that is what has got to change,\" Sturgeon said.Sturgeon, head of the Scottish National Party, has said her government is preparing for all possibilities, including independence from the UK, after Britain leaves the EU. She wants each of the UK's four assemblies to get a vote on the proposed negotiating package.In Northern Ireland, there are fears that Brexit could undermine a 1998 peace deal and lead to the reintroduction of unpopular and cumbersome controls on the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the devolved nations had to be at \"the heart of the process\" so that issues relevant to them could be tackled as they arose.Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said it was difficult for the devolved administrations to influence the process when there was so much uncertainty over what the government was seeking.Jones said he had argued very strongly for \"full and unfettered access\" to the EU's single market, which is in doubt because EU leaders say it would require Britain to continue to accept EU freedom of movement rules. One of the central planks of the pro-Brexit campaign was that exiting the EU would give Britain greater control over immigration and help reduce the numbers arriving in the country.

conglomerate HNA Group said on Monday it would buy about 25 percent of hotel operator and manager Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc from biggest shareholder Blackstone Group LP for $6.5 billion.Shares of Hilton, whose brands include Conrad Hotels & Resorts, Curio and Double Tree as well as Hilton, rose as much as 3.71 percent to $23.76 in early trading.HNA Group will buy the stake for $26.25 per share, representing a premium of 14.6 percent to Hilton's closing price on Friday and valuing the hotel company at about $26 billion.Blackstone took Hilton private in 2007 for $26.7 billion, including debt. In 2013, the private equity firm listed the company in the biggest-ever hotel IPO. (reut.rs/2exryfE)This is HNA Group's second investment in the U.S. hospitality industry this year. The company agreed in April to buy Carlson Hotels Inc, the owner of the Radisson hotel chain, including its 51.3 percent majority stake in Rezidor Hotel Group AB, for an undisclosed sum.Chinese companies have been splurging on foreign acquisitions to sidestep slowing growth at home.Overseas mergers and acquisitions by Chinese companies have touched a record $181 billion so far this year, about 70 percent more than the whole of last year.HNA Group's Avolon Holdings agreed earlier this month to buy CIT Group's aircraft leasing assets worth $10 billion in a deal that will create the world's third-largest lessor.However, Chinese insurer Anbang Insurance Group Co, which bought the iconic Waldorf Astoria in New York in 2015, abandoned its pursuit of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide following a bidding war with Marriott International Inc.Marriott completed the acquisition of Starwood in September to create the world's biggest hotel chain. (reut.rs/2exdDpz)HNA Group said on Monday it will also own a stake of about 25 percent in Hilton's real estate and timeshare businesses, following their expected separation by the end of 2016. The deal will allow the HNA Group to appoint two directors to Hilton's board, raising its size to 10.

of this year's race for the White House is souring young Americans, turning some away from the democratic process just as the millennial generation has become as large a potential bloc of voters as the baby boomers.Reuters/Ipsos polling shows that Americans aged 18 to 34 are slightly less likely to vote for president this year than their comparably aged peers were in 2012. Some political scientists worry that this election could scar a generation of voters, making them less likely to cast ballots in the future.Young Americans on the left and right have found reasons to be dissatisfied with their choices this year. Senator Bernie Sanders had an enthusiastic following of younger people before he lost the Democratic primary race to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. On the Republican side, some are unwilling to vote for Donald Trump, citing the New York businessman's sometimes insulting rhetoric on women, minorities and immigrants.Brandon Epstein, who turned 18 on Monday, had looked forward earlier in the year to casting his first vote for Sanders. Now, the resident of suburban Suffolk County, New York, plans to sit out the vote on Election Day, Nov. 8.\"It's because of the selection of the candidates. I find them to be not just sub-par, but unusually sub-par,\" said Epstein, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"Something's gone terribly wrong.\"That sentiment is broadly reflected in poll data that show that young Americans are less enthusiastic about their choices in November than they were four years ago when Democratic President Barack Obama faced a re-election challenge from Republican Mitt Romney.Some 52.2 percent of respondents aged 18 to 34 told Reuters/Ipsos they were certain or almost certain to vote, compared with 56.1 percent who reported that level of certainty at the same point in 2012.The national tracking poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 3,088 people between 18-34 years old who took the survey from Oct. 1 to Oct. 17, and 2,141 18-34 year olds who took the poll on the same days in 2012. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points for both groups.'DEEP CYNICISM'For at least the past half century, young Americans have voted at lower rates than their elders. But this year's decline in enthusiasm is of particular concern because it comes as the millennial generation - people born from 1981 through 1997 - has become as large a bloc of eligible voters as the baby boomers - born between 1946 and 1964. Each group's number of eligible voters is approaching 70 million people, according to the Pew Research Center.\"This generation has never trusted the government, Wall Street or the media less,\" John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, said of the millennials. \"That's likely to result in turnout of less than 50 percent and of those who do turn out, there is still a deep cynicism regarding the impact of their vote, whether or not it will make a difference.\"The projected low turnout is a particular concern given recent research showing how important habit is in encouraging voter participation. Put simply, a person who votes in one election is about 10 percent more likely to vote in the next than an eligible voter who opted to stay home, said Alexander Coppock, an assistant professor of political science at Yale University.\"If you extend that logic, if you have an election that fails to turn people on to voting, you'd expect that you wouldn't get that cumulative effect,\" said Coppock, whose article \"Is Voting Habit Forming?\" was published in this month's issue of the American Journal for Political Science.However, not all young voters unhappy with their choices will be staying home. Some plan to cast a ballot anyway, even if only in protest, rather than sitting out.That group includes Cameron Khansarinia, a 20-year-old vice president of the Harvard Republican Club, who said he would cast a ballot even though he opposed Trump.\"I will definitely vote, I just don't know if I will be writing someone in or voting for (Libertarian) Gary Johnson or even voting for Hillary Clinton when it gets down to it,\" said Khansarinia, who is registered to vote in heavily Democratic California. \"Once this is over, come Nov. 9, we will need people here to rebuild the party.\" (Reporting

Iraq Islamic State expanded its attacks on Monday against Iraqi army and Kurdish forces to relieve pressure on its militants confronting an offensive on Mosul, its last major urban stronghold in the country.About 80 Islamic State-held villages and towns have been retaken in the first week of the offensive, bringing the Iraqi and Kurdish forces closer to the edge of the city itself - where the battle will be hardest fought.The Mosul campaign, which aims to crush the Iraqi half of Islamic State's declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria, may be the biggest battle yet in the 13 years of turmoil triggered by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and could require a massive humanitarian relief operation.Some 1.5 million residents remain in the city and worst-case forecasts see up to a million being uprooted, according to the United Nations. U.N. aid agencies said the fighting has so far forced about 6,000 to flee their homes.In a series of counter-attacks on far-flung targets across Iraq since Friday, Islamic State fighters have hit Kirkuk, the north's main oil city, the town of Rutba that controls the road from Baghdad to Jordan and Syria, and Sinjar, a region west of Mosul inhabited by the persecuted Yazidi minority.Yazidi provincial chief Mahma Xelil said the Sinjar attack was the most violent in the area in the last year.He said at least 15 militants were killed in the two-hour battle and a number of their vehicles were destroyed, while the peshmerga suffered two wounded. Islamic State said two peshmerga vehicles were destroyed and all those on board were killed. Islamic State committed some of its worst atrocities in Sinjar when it swept through the Yazidi region two years ago, killing men, kidnapping children and enslaving women. Kurdish fighters took back the region a year ago.The Yazidis are a religious sect whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions and who speak one of the Kurdish languages. They are considered infidels by the hardline Sunni Islamist militants.REGIONAL INTERVENTIONThe Iraqi force attacking Mosul is 30,000-strong, joined by U.S. special forces and under American, French and British air cover. The number of insurgents dug in the city is estimated at 5,000 to 6,000 by the Iraqi military.The Mosul campaign has drawn in many regional players, highlighting how Iraq is being used as a platform for influence between rival parties - Sunni-ruled Turkey and its Gulf allies and Shi’ite Iran and its client Iraqi militias.Turkey and Iraq's Shi'ite-dominated central government are at loggerheads about the presence of Turkish troops at a camp in northern Iraq, without approval from Baghdad's Shi'ite-led government.Ankara fears that Shi'ite militias, which have been accused of abuses against Sunni civilians elsewhere, will be used in the Mosul offensive. Turkey's own presence in Iraq has also helped inflame sectarian passions.It was from Mosul's Grand Mosque that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate over parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014. Within a year his group was in retreat in Iraq, having lost the Sunni cities of Tikrit, Ramadi and Falluja.The Iraqi army last week dislodged the insurgents from the main Christian region east of Mosul and its elite unit, the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) has pressed ahead with operations to clear more villages since Saturday.CTS forces took three villages west of the Christian town of Bartella in an early morning attack on Monday and are now outside Bazwaia village, between five and seven km (three to four miles) east of Mosul, Lieutenant General Abdel Ghani al-Assadi told Reuters.The region of Nineveh around Mosul is a mosaic of ethnic and religious groups - Arabs, Turkmen, Kurds, Yazidis, Christians, Sunnis, Shi'ites - with Sunni Arabs the overwhelming majority.  The army's press office said a total of 78 villages and town have been recaptured between Oct. 17, when the Mosul operation started, and until Sunday evening. More than 770 Islamic State fighters have been killed and 23 captured. One hundred and twenty-seven car bombs used in suicide attacks on advancing troops have been destroyed, according to an army statement.Islamic State says it has killed hundreds of fighters from the attacking forces and blocked their progress. The army is trying to advance from the south and the east while Kurdish peshmerga fighters are holding fronts in the east and north.The distance from the frontlines to the built-up area of Mosul ranges from 40 kilometers (25 miles), in the south, to 5 kilometers at the closest, in the east.After Islamic State's attack on Friday in Kirkuk, the hardline Sunni militant group has launched other diversionary attacks in Sinjar and Rutba, 360 km west of Baghdad, where they killed at least seven policemen, according to security sources.Federal police units arrived in Rutba overnight to back up the local forces, according to the sources who estimate that 16  insurgents have been killed so far. Islamic State said in an online statement that dozens of security force members and pro-government Sunni tribal forces had fled Rutba.
